Slaves were forbidden to read. For the life of me I don't get why some Black folks today won't let that motivate them. #12YearsASlave
---
Loved the viewing of #12YearsASlave, but the Q and A was a trip. One sister tried to make the point that Blacks are still enslaved.

At the screening of 12 YEARS A SLAVE! So excited to see this movie. Comes out October 18#12yearsaslave #support
---
Slavery is in the foundation of the institutional racism today. But I sure as hell will fight to blow up that foundation! #12YearsASlave
---
I raised the issue of Black kids today not reading and slaves not being allowed to read. They HUNGERED for knowledge. #12YearsASlave
---
I'm not going to be play that victim role as if I'm still enslaved. I don't deny the legacy of slavery. But I'm not chained! #12YearsASlave
---
Folks need to understand that covert racism is deadly as overt racism. But that still ain't the same as slavery. #12YearsASlave
---
When I said there are free Black folks, she asked, "Who?" I said, "Hell, me!" That set some brother off on the front row. #12YearsASlave
---
Families were torn apart in slavery. But I won't let that determine my family's destiny today. Reverse that nonsense! #12YearsASlave
---
I've faced racism head on. I know about the slights, code language. But that don't compare to my flesh ripped apart by a whip #12YearsASlave
---
My premise tonight at #12YearsASlave was basic: I'm a free man. @AfricanaCarr objected. I'm more than happy to debate the issue.
