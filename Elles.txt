Would Harvey Weinstein have settled for a NC-17 rating for ELLES, or argued for a PG-13, due to its instructive/philosophical value?
---
@biobot :) Blame @spillly (with 2 elles)
---
@broke_grove @nikhilshah @sitcbootcamp what Elles said

@NickyM96 Krissy and Mikey are both very affectionate and mushy with me, but Elle's all about her daddy

I really enjoyed the #film Elles @IFI_Dub uncomfortable viewing at times but Juliette Binoche & an amazing female cast = #mesmerising
---
@robbiereviews @GuyLodge I think Joanna Kulig in Elles is the closest challenger to McTeer's supremacy in the Boob Flash 2012 league.
---
@ConradHotels not tonight, but tomorrow I'll be at Elles screening at CCC &amp; then Knife Fight back here at BMCC #TFF
---
@NinjaWorrier Hey, have you seen Marley or Elles or Breathing or Damsels In Distress? All 3 are on tomorrow &amp; I fancy seeing a movie while..
---
@francinegorman Think Le Havre and Elles are both supposed to be good, if they're your sort of thing at all? Showing at Curzons at the mo :)
