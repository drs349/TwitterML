Liked ONLY THE YOUNG (thanks @gemko ) but wish someone had asked the Christian teen in the Crass jacket what he thought of "Reality Asylum."

Two picks for @MovieOfTheWeekThatIsntOurs, both from @OscopeLabs - ONLY THE YOUNG and TCHOUPITOULAS both open IFC Center. Double feature it.
---
@scottEweinberg which do you need to catch up on. I really think you should see Only the Young. And The House I Live In.
---
@EricDSnider have you seen Only the Young yet? That depiction is even better.
---
@scottrenshaw The doc ONLY THE YOUNG. Also, STARLET. I'm guessing you've seen THE GREY (not obscure, but easy to forget so early in year).
---
@tapestore I don't think that's the task of a film like ONLY THE YOUNG. We live in the context and can bring our own societal framing.
---
@OscopeLabs @otyfilm @ifccenter can I say Only the Young and Tchoupitoulas? Love those films.
