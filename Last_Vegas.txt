---
@david_j_roth @rlegrid i laughed involuntarily at a last vegas ad last night, so I'm probably just overcompensating now
---
@msicism That would result in LAST VEGAS throwing its back out.
---
@ValCox75 ya Last Vegas is next on my list.  No interest in seeing Carrie (not into horror flicks)
---
@kateyrich sounds like you need a good comedy with heart and an amazing cast, might we recommend Last Vegas in theaters Friday!

@patsajak Assuming "Last Vegas" features a montage of wacky hi-jinks to "Walking On Sunshine"

@Justin_Stangel Why didn't they combine Ender's Game &amp; Last Vegas and create one giant crappy movie?

@scratchbomb @TheSpoony There's a 17 minute section of LAST VEGAS where Morgan Freeman records narration for an entirely unrelated movie.

---
However, the previews for "Last Vegas" make me want to hang out with Morgan Freeman in Vegas.

---
#lastvegas that got 50 cent ole ugly ass in the movie 
---
I don't think I will be going to the #LastVegas Advance Screening Tomorrow

This must be at least the fifth movie Morgan Freeman has been in this year. #LAStVEGAS

Do you think they tested the title "The Hang Older" before they settled on "Last Vegas?" I do.
---
There's no way a movie rated PG-13 that takes place in Vegas can be that funny #LastVegas
---
Saw Last Vegas.  So funny!!!!
---
Excited to go see Last Vegas tomorrow! It looks so funny!
---
I need a date to go see Last Vegas. But they need to be a mute. No one talks while Morgan Freeman is talking.
---
So, is Last Vegas basically The Hangover sponsored by AARP?
---
My report on the making of 'Last Vegas': It's not necessarily about the city of old http://t.co/KeGcuMKnEs
---
Just saw a preview for #LastVegas , looks like it could have been better had they made it R rated. It's a Vegas (Sin City) comedy!!
---
Clearly they had more fun making Last Vegas than I did watching it.
---
Can't even lie I wanna see last Vegas really bad
---
@CBSFilms Last Vegas was AWESOME!!!! Great Movie.
---
Last Vegas was funny! Morgan Freeman was a trip! #LastVegas
---
Last Vegas just seems like early release of The Hangover 12

Dear Robert DeNiro: You're funny. We get it. Now please either make good movies again, or just retire. Sincerely yours, EVERYONE #LastVegas

Why do they continue to make shitty movies in the Last Vegas concept? I wouldnt even pause to watch it on Starz.
