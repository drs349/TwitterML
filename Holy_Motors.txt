@retroramblings How was Holy Motors?
---
CLOUD ATLAS and HOLY MOTORS are the strangest of bedfellows--though the former is more of a badly drawn, over-the-top wicked stepsister.

@GoodbootsFilm However, I do think HOLY MOTORS is about other things more specific than just "the cinema."

@michaelragen @rileystearns genuinely advise seeing Carax's other films before seeing Holy Motors.

@silent_london 'Beast of the Southern Wild / John Dies at the End' on the one hand, and 'Holy Motors' on the other. Have only seen latter.

@jessica_khogg what's that? Still haven't seen looper or holy motors

@ColeWBradley Especially since Holy Motors has the one-two punch of being completely original and showcasing a powerhouse lead performance.

@kiwipom HOLY MOTORS was 5 stars. It's his first 5 star film this year. - not a guest writer, he is now part of the site.

Holy Motors could also be titled Reflections on Life as an Actor. Except for that bit at the end. That's just totally unexplainable.

Coincidentally, it seems that Denis Lavant reprises his "character" from the anthology film, TOKYO!, in the new film, HOLY MOTORS.

On Sat, I'm seeing Holy Motors, Everything Will Be OK Trilogy, and John Dies at the End. Think it's OK to put The Sessions in front of that?
