@robbiereviews Very bold! After the Sightseers Q&amp;A I'd say this adds considerable extra value - BW was very engaging...

@calummarsh I've not seen Down Terrace, but Sightseers was excellent and Kill List was a manipulative, well-made, sadistic bore.

@filmdotcom both Kill List and Sightseers are sadistically amazing
---
@EXECUTIVESTEVE Will have to check it out; the general unpleasantness of 'Kill List' and 'Sightseers' put me off thus far.

@SchmoesKnow 1. Iron Man 3   2. The Great Gatsby 3. 42 4.Sightseers 5. Aftershock
---
@MsAnnieRam thank you birthday girl , thankfully we didn't encounter any 'sightseers' types!
---
@BFI #Amour, superb, masterclass in acting, prob won't watch a 2nd time though!
#sightseers, disappointing, not as good as I hoped.
---
I'm not an American, @alicelowe, but I saw #Sightseers (sadly, only once) and all good Americans will watch, too - or I'll kill 'em all !
---
@alicelowe I loved Sightseers, Steve Oram was great, but you were outstanding in the film. You're a fantastic actor Alice.
---
@mondocurry You're welcome!  Thanks for saving me a seat. Let me know of any future free movie predictions.  Sightseers was a good one!
---
@Lloyd_84 I've only seen it and Down Terrace. Have you seen Sightseers yet?
---
@C_Mcfc Any good? If so might give it a visit. Fave film from last 6mths is Sightseers. Hilarious!! Well worth a watch!!
---
@Ti_West Saw Sightseers, very good. And you look for another indie film, Bellflower, if you didnt see. Great stuff for 17 thousand dollars
---
. @themarina @alicelowe You'll be glad to hear SIGHTSEERS is coming to Vancity Theatre, July 19. (Worth the long wait!)
---
@alicelowe heard about Sightseers from the Kermodes and it sounds great! cant wait to see it over here in California :D
---
@alicelowe Which locations did you visit during the Sightseers shoot? Was in the Lake District last June and want to compare : )
---
@Killpandakill (2) Best 1st views- "Faster", "Skyfall", "To Catch A Thief", "Tower Block", "Get the Gringo", "Ted", "Hanna", "Sightseers".
