Right, time for "Sightseers". Loved this at Abertoir last year, very much due a rewatch. #Sightseers

Watching Sightseers and have realised that's what I was looking for. Someone who will commit a series of gruesome murders for me.
---
The only 2013 movies I've liked so far: The Place Beyond the Pines, To the Wonder, Sightseers, and Phil Spector.
