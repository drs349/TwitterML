Yesterday I saw THE WOLVERINE again. I stand by my initial statement: It's the best superhero movie of the summer http://t.co/AiKTAzpBZN
---
#TheWolverine was surprisingly good. The most enjoyable time I've had with a comic superhero movie all year.
---

I may be a dissenting voice in this regard, but I liked X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE better than THE WOLVERINE.

You're not going to want to stay during the credits of THE WOLVERINE. Nope. Nothing to see. #liesfilthylies

If you sit through the end credits of The Wolverine, Samuel L. Jackson shows up and explains licensing restrictions
---
The way they portray Wolvie lost his adamantium claws in #theWolverine is pathetic.
---
Nearly time for the wolverine. @rebeccaslater plans the best nights!

Can't deny, I giggled a little when cropping the Wolverine pic for the 'Out this week' section of the homepage. http://t.co/C4S9BXHuv1

---
Might go see The Wolverine tonight
---
If THE WOLVERINE proves one thing, it's that no one should ever sleep next to Logan under any circumstances.
---
"The Wolverine" good movie..Lots of plot building..Great action..Stay for the credits (Nerds lost their shit during the bonus scene)!!!!
---
anyone saw "The Wolverine"? How was it? #hebat
---
#TheWolverine didn't blow me away, but it's probably the best movie yet to feature the character. Mind you, I'm not an #XMen fan...
---
#theWolverine #trivia Hugh Jackman is in his best form in this film, he asked the ROCK for the advice to bulk up.
---
And pull the got damn camera back!  If a bunch of peope are fighting why is the camera shoved up #TheWolverine's nose. man foh wit that shit
---
Gotta love that foam finger swag. #TheWolverine http://t.co/0sNJvyCHK0

---
comparing X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE and THE WOLVERINE is not fair, because in my book the first one never existed.
---
Lmaooooooo. It's as if the entire Africa came to watch the Wolverine today in GDC. I hope it would be worth all the hype
---
If the after credits scene in #TheWolverine bridges to #DaysOfFuturePast I will lose my fucking mind.
---
The Wolverine is easily one of the best Marvel comic book character films, dont hesitate to go see it this weekend.
---
The Wolverine better be good...I better not walk out the theatre regretting my $7.50 purchase.

The Wolverine is like 'Wolverine Tour to Japan'. Campy, corny, but still entertaining. Love the Shinkansen scene! (6.1/10)
---
"The Wolverine" makes the most aggressive case for not seeing it in 3D. No sequence at all shot for that format in the slightest. (KJ)
