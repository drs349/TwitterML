@camcharron But regardless, he is so clutch! Look at all the clutchiness he has on the ice!

Good start to the game, sloppy 3rd period and bad loss. Was a treat to play with @viss9 & @mnason_9 though. Felt at home on the ice again

@SwallowMyWrdz the wind is terrible.. I just stand on the ice and it blows me to my dorm.. I'm going to Korea and spending it all tho lol

One can assume #Oilers Renney not being on the ice for a couple days is maybe he's in negotiations to be re-upped or sending feelers out.

@JH_1974 Drinking on the ice would make it more fun!

@JeffreyKirchick @hackswithhaggs They cheered for a long time while Salo was laying on the ice, but I can see the difference.
---
@LetMeUpgradeYou lol but yeah i got you on the ice cream for sure.....
---
@SUN_TYCHKOWSKI odd, considering all 3 were on the ice when the puck went in the net.
---
@habberfied They are finally comfortable with it, and getting better and putting it on the ice every shift, it's great

@MichaelMurphy31 glad you are back on the ice; #supermanreturns

@OnFrozenPond tell him to not be fine with it and get his butt back on the ice! It's a necessity!

@holyhabs87 They need to get him on the ice. Habs are sellers anyway, and his value drops when he sits. @SeriousFan09
---
@HawksFactCheck  I'm not buying it on the ice... PIM machine on a team w/ a shitty PK unit. Need more Mayers, not headless chickens

@RainingCatz lol don't rush my dad told me once when he rings the bell on the ice cream van it means he has run out of  lollies #tightwad

@silent_shadow36 Is Chara on the ice crying? No? BOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
@FiveHoleLuck I'd rather have Bickell on the ice than Scott.

@_TyAnderson He was the best player on the ice in every game I've covered him in this year. He's going to be a star.

@Drew_Meekins How was your day on the ice? :-)
---
@TmoNews Have you heard anything on the Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade for the Galaxy SII?
---
@aka_elvis This year nothing has translated on the ice. We just have to accept that. DD has been the best player. This is a problem.

@koedyburkel well he slid on the ice and then flipped his truck four times...
---
@CHEXNewsWatch I'd get thrown out if I wore golf shoes on the ice!

@GAC_Angels FORGET WHAT. YOU KNOW ABOUT ROLLER SKATING ON THE ICE IS DIFFERENT. I USED TO DO BOTH

@goaliemom31 But some genius tossed it on the ice in CBJ! What a waste of a perfectly good piece of deliciousness.

@ChrisDayo They'll probably slip on the ice and hit their heads first and forget how awesome I am.
---
@yoyoha you just huff the air out of the reddi whip can instead of putting it on the ice cream.
---
@Jay_Grub Wasn't the worst player on the ice last night.  Trade coming?

@AJKimb That would be hell to clean up on the ice.

@inthefade Are the Rangers even on the ice?

@habsinsideout1 lonely, so lonely he has nobodyyyy on the ice ..lol
---
@Gimchihabster Not true. Showcasing happens all the time. Coaches get marching orders from GM to get guys on the ice for visiting scouts.
---
@ivaibadza well it was you that actually choked on the ice cube :/
---
@jdf5046 but when u see blood on the ice like when stamkos got hit here thats when u need to tone down the hate.
---
@lindmich86 @mirtle people still think Bergeron isn't the first line centre? He's on the top scoring line thats on the ice the most.
---
@halladayfan32 umm I know how to not fall on the ice. I know how to stand still like a pylon #fitinwiththeD
---
@sxwxgirl1 Yes, we will be on the ice road in a couple of days!
---
@Kim_Rasmussen1 Truth. We're gonna have to witness Scooter on the big screen making his debut back on the ice. Throw a mini 2 person party!
---
@dapperderp LOL. I have a series of 13 pics from just one single minute on the ice that are so exquisite I almost can't bear them.
---
@hockeypuck30 If Cole hadn't stepped in, I think Timmy would have put PK on the ice.
---
@xo_coll did u have a hat to throw on the ice? hahaha
---
@MichaelMurphy31 Yay! Glad you're back on the ice & even more happy that you feel good, too. You'll be back in the game before we know it!
---
@kyleroussel have to agree. fans expect ak to be best player on the ice all the time. he isnt that player. he is very good though.
---
@That_OneGirl_ just be chill on the ice cream miss
---
@EvilJeanyis I use to iceskate a lot as a kid and I was a cheerleader and ran a lot. Popped my knee doing an axle on the ice smfh
---
@Peter_Espinola Phaneuf makes me nervous every second he's on the ice.
---
@TheTealLadies man everyone always looks so terrible in their roster photos! Let's hope he looks better on the ice!
---
@ScottGummerson yeah, at a skate park bit of a mess around. Very different to what I'm use to on the ice!

@julietims You missed my latest excuse for not running. Fell over on the ice on Friday. Lots of bruising. :-(

@mickey_lee2 (Laughs) Ya sound just like Ma tellin me ta be careful on the ice. Have a good night, sir!
---
@toddrose24 all good dude I'm just worked up. Thats what being a fan is all about. two points left on the ice that we will need come april 7
---
@PeteSchaad Dave Tippett is the new Jacques Lemaire.  Its like watching me on the ice.
---
@TPirozzi no it will be good to be a fan because while Nash works in theory and on paper, it doesn't work on the ice. Its in my next article
---
@Chrisbaker1983 I hope so. I want to see someone break his nose. Terrible to say, but I hope someone teaches him a lesson on the ice...soon
---
@Sara_Runs yep! Just fine! Was being over cautious on the ice & that back fired...
---
@NickFr33man  never happened while me and @Sburke19 were on the ice
---
@KasiaLi we both skidded on the ice :(
---
@mise35 Yes and on the ice, Hiller acts as a chemical bonding agent. His timely saves and elite skills bring team play in d-zone together.
---
@frozenroyalty I'll be on the ice tonight. I haven't gotten to throw a t-shirt this season! Probably for the best, last time wasn't pretty.
---
@JaredOfLondon @67sound Which is why we use the advanced stats. He's on the ice for &lt; 24 shots against per 60 minutes. That counts, right?
---
@darrylw71 ~ I know!  Even *I* am a sensible Canadian girl on the ice... And I still went down hard :-p Ugh!  Kimmy will have a few bruises!
---
@AKrygier Yep. There's been one real constant on the ice for the past 10ish years. Plus, I'd rather lose a Captain than an entire team
---
@Mongeon53 Kessel and Lupul get routinely out-shot when they're on the ice together.
---
@Schultz88 IMO stay on the ice. the whole arena/moving thing is a distraction. next four games are huge for this team. need to vault WPG
---
@chrisg1980 It's that sport played on the ice with sticks and a ball right? LOL
---
@JeffBrewer1 They're missing something. Imagine putting Nash, Richards and Gaborik on the ice in crunch time.
---
@aynsilly thx aynsley. i did want to get out on the ice at some point today. hopefully the snow won't turn to rain..
---
@blakeprice1040 if bieksa was on the ice probably not a bad idea.  Raymond looks terribad out there.
---
@theScore I'll ask AGAIN: did u post video of Bruins fans cheering when Raymond was lying on the ice w/ a broken back last year? #Hypocrite
---
@AbqDunn I drive an Audi A6, but the dude in the Z3 on the ice rink that is Eubank needs his head checked.
---
@mlse @JaredOfLondon Rangers have dramatically outshot and outscored opposition with him on the ice. He's doing something right.
---
@MinnyCapsFan Yeah, I agree. But they put a goon that can barely play hockey on the ice instead. Not very constructive, IMO.
---
