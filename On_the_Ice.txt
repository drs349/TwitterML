Looks like Moulson's hand is ok, as he's on the ice. He could not get the puck passed Elliott on the last play. #isles
---
Another one of the many reasons @10_AMac is in such great game shape is the help he got from former #Blues player @JamieRivers08 on the ice.
---
A guaranteed way to cheer you up when the Leafs are losing is whenever Grabovski's on the ice, imagine him going "AAAHHHH!!" the whole time.
---
Like all penalties on the ice, not all "clips" rise to the level of supplemental discipline. This... http://t.co/wLkH8dxO

Lots of ICE breaking in 2012. BIG Miracle, Thin Ice, On the Ice.

The Blackhawks just committed too many men on the ice, with puck right in front of their bench, on the power play. 9 game losing streak

Jeff Carter and Rick Nash are not on the ice at #CBJ practice. No word on the motives. The speculation is on.

Looks like they used a fire extinguisher on the ice in the corner. I don't think I need a witty remark to that. Help me out here, @DaveLozo

Weak sauce move by the Habs fans. Tomas Plekanec hits Zdeno Chara in the face w/puck & crowd roars loudly w/Chara down on the ice. Classless
---
Toronto fans should throw something that hasn't been cool since 2004 on the ice to make their point. Were pogs cool in 2004?
---
#Habs Yannick Weber jumps on the ice in a teal (!) practice jersey. Assuming that means no contact, but either way it's not right.
---
#FlaPanthers assistant coaches running optional morning skate, with most players out on the ice, including both goalies.
---
Blackhawks with too many humans on the ice. 4-on-4 for 36 seconds, then a Rangers PP that really needs a goal to have a chance.
---
Jay-Z on the ears, #Canucks on the ice. Warm-up is a go! (Foo Fighters pre warm-up = awesome)
