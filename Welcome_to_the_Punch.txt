Deciding whether to see the new Nic Cage film, or the Brit crime flick Welcome to the Punch tonight. Tough choice. Neither is 'good'...

@empiretheatres Canadian fans report that Welcome to the Punch was released 3/22 but no showtimes yet listed. Help!

---
Well, so far I can only find WELCOME TO THE PUNCH opening at @IFCCenter in NYC on Weds., 3/27. Let me know if you hear/see other showings!
---
#WelcomeToThePunch - entirely predictable, totally generic &amp; fairly entertaining. Thank god for Mark Strong being in it basically.
---
Seem to have gone on a James McAvoy binge somehow. Welcome to the Punch, Neverwhere and Trance. Not complaining, all great stuff
---
But yeah, really enjoyed Welcome to the Punch, despite it being rather rote. It was *snigger* punchy. And shooty.
---
Per @empiretheatres: We still dont know Canadian release date for James McAvoy's WELCOME TO THE PUNCH. Keep checking back on website!
---
"@wobberlyrobbie: "@YoungReyes: Welcome to the punch?" let me know how it is, it looks decent" was okay, nothing too special!

James McAvoy's WELCOME TO THE PUNCH opens tmw 3/27 at @IFCCenter in NYC: http://t.co/f8GFvbIs6n You lucky New Yorkers!

Go see Welcome To The Punch. Slick, full of action, absolutely gripping. Is Eran Creevy the next Michael Mann? Stylistically, yes he is.
---
Sunday cinema marathon has just finished. We watched 'Jack the Giant Slayer', 'Welcome To The Punch' &amp;  'Oz: The Great &amp; Powerful' Now food!

#MovieNFO ( Welcome to the Punch ) Cast : James McAvoy, Mark Strong, Andrea Riseborough, David Morrissey.

Welcome To The Punch...easily could have set it in America w/ Tom Cruise,&amp;Liam Neeson as police captain,glad they kept it Lahndahn #youslags
---
Who'd have thunk it? Two James McAvoy movies I wanna watch. "Welcome to the Punch" and Danny Boyle's "Trance".

@charismagic how did you find welcome to the punch ?
---
@electroross aw i've got it too! I was gonna bring you it. I hope you like it :)
I saw Welcome to the punch today, was good.
---
@brianshelf Mainly because Welcome to the Punch is filmed like a Channel 4 late night drama and doesn't look like a film.
---
@mannerschelmo get to see films you'd otherwise not perhaps take the risk on, like I did with Welcome to the Punch on Saturday.
---
@LondonMovieLoon I couldn't even remember what Welcome to the Punch was when you said it there. Amazing how quickly these films evaporate.

@adilray avoid welcome to the punch!
---
@deepan88 But! There's also Side Effects, Welcome to the Punch and Trance to watch. Hard hard choices x
---
Welcome to the Punch OK double-crossing shoot-em-up. Strong &amp; Mullan good double act but can't take McAvoy seriously with ginger bumfluff.
---
Boom 

@Team_Maza: Welcome to the punch is number 3 in sky's UK top 10!! @Welcome2Punch @JasonMaza
---
@maridt3 2 movies coming out: Welcome to the Punch (3/27) and Danny Boyle's Trance (4/5). ALSO listen to this: http://t.co/EhaMGOGelf
---
@SarsBe Welcome to the Punch.
I like James Mcavoy and Mark Strong. It's looks really good.
---
@brianshelf Indeed, and gore. He does gore well. It is better than McAvoy's other film Welcome to the Punch.
---
@picturehouses Danny Boyle's has made a successful comeback. And I have forgiven James McAvoy for Welcome to the Punch.
---
@NinaWarhurst Seen "welcome to the punch"? Enjoyed that slightly more
---
Seriously @CineStHelens Please tell me you didn't just post a massive spoiler in my timeline for Welcome To The Punch?!
---
@satyamos welcome to the punch or identity thief at 9? which one
---
@thommoj03 yeah it seams that way. It was similar to welcome to the punch although that was just a strange aqua neon in every scene
---
@zoee89 can confirm McSexy is indeed sexy in Welcome to the Punch but more excited about Trance. Scottish accent plus Danny Boyle.
---
@BFI any news on when the videos from the Wadjda &amp; Welcome to the Punch Q&amp;A's going up, been checking the website, but to no avail
---
@Jenpen21 @kezza1421 Cool. I want to try and catch Oz and Welcome to the punch tomorrow too, but have to be home to cook tea
---
@jpowls have you seen Welcome To The Punch?  Quite good fun, not a massive surprise.  I'm currently in the cinema awaiting Arbitrage.
---
@IFCFilms Fans are asking if WELCOME TO THE PUNCH will get a wider theatrical release in US beyond NY/LA? Please...
---
@hattiepearson @darrylmorris Compliance, Side Effects, The Paperboy, Welcome to the Punch?
---
@Jenpen21 @kezza1421 Have you seen Welcome to the Punch? I think it goes this week but there is a showing at Didsbury, Thursday at 19:00
---
@_DaltMorrissey @samrogerson2 Have you seen Welcome to the Punch or Red Dawn? :)
---
#WelcomeToThePunch was a great film. Really enjoyed it from start to finish.
---
Saw Welcome to the Punch last night. Liked it better than Oz but not as much as Life of Pi.
---
Django Unchained' and 'Welcome To The Punch' are two smashing films. If you disagree you deserve a place at the naughty corner.
---
Of to see welcome to the punch with my dad
---
Welcome To The Punch followed by Red Dawn. The dull followed by the preposterous. An evening I will never get back.
---
Mrs Z3 is picking the wee yin later, I'm gonna go see Welcome To The Punch. Tuesday.
---
Congratulation james mcavoy and mark strong you have just made one of the greatest most exciting n well made movies ever #welcometothepunch
---
Oh, James McAvoy. I have done nothing but love and support you, why must you punish me? #welcometothepunch
---
Shittest film of 2013 so far goes to Welcome to the Punch
---
Went to see welcome to the punch this evening, well worth a watch. James McEvoy is just great in everything!

The only good thing about Welcome To The Punch; James McAvoy's facial hair

Welcome to the punch it is!! @Harvey143 better be good!!

#WelcomeToThePunch: great production values but the film rests on J McAvoy convincing as a tough guy. His pubey beard just doesn't cut it

Welcome to the Punch: An extraordinarily stylish British crime thriller: excellent action and great leads in Mark Strong And James McAvoy

Welcome To The Punch is decent. A solid 8/10. Mark Strong is quality, McAvoy is good and Orient fan Danny Mays does a good job in it.

Spring Breakers, Olympus Has Fallen, The Host, Trance, Place Beyond The Pines, Welcome To The Punch..I could do without OHF. But the others!

Was hoping to get 2 #reviews up this weekend but only got round to seeing 1 #film in the end. 'WELCOME TO THE PUNCH' will be up later today!
---
#WelcomeToThePunch is fantastic overall. However special mention to @harryescott for some really top cues. Some great music in there!
---
Welcome To The Punch was of the napper and so were all the sweets and chocolate that Nat bought for me because I am skint!
---
Watched #welcometothepunch and liked it. Even though it was a half arsed, unoriginal and uninspiring story. A good Sunday matinee though...

Off to watch 'Welcome To The Punch'

@R1Breakfast he is gorgeous! Such a sweetheart. Loved welcome to the punch can't wait to see trance!

And although Welcome To The Punch was good, I have a feeling that Trance is going to be so much better.
---
Welcome To The Punch gotta be the best movie out in 2013. pure action
---
'Welcome to the punch' is the biggest load of shit I've seen in 3 years or more. Awful

#WelcomeToThePunch Comparable to the Sweeney but lacks the attitude and strong personality for a Brit cop thriller. A good attempt for ..
---
Really want to see Welcome to the Punch because James McAvoy, mmm
---
I was looking forward to my evening with James McAvoy... But it was awful. Don't go see Welcome to the Punch. Ever.
---
Cinema to see welcome to the punch... Better be good! Overdosing on pick n mix
---
Just saw 'welcome to the punch' and 'the croos' both brilliant
---
Cinema Sunday saw Jack the Giant Slayer, Welcome to the Punch and Oz, all of which were all right, I guess Oz was the best.
---
Who doesnt love James mcavoy: Welcome to the Punch on @hulu: http://t.co/vLvaYuOTlb
---
3 minutes into Welcome To The Punch someone says to James McAvoy "you're obsessed! you're not thinking straight!" that's damn good writing
---
Still don't quite know what to make of Welcome to the Punch... Some epic action scenes I know that!
---
Now at the cinema watching welcome to the punch :P
---
London has never looked as cool as it does in #WelcomeToThePunch , the new crime flick from @ECreevy : http://t.co/13FCx0OSP7 #filmreviews
---
This is becoming a regular thing.... Empty cinema with just us 3. @jgiordano4 @hgrimbley #welcometothepunch
---
Alright McAvoy leave some for the rest of us! #WelcomeToThePunch #Trance #Macbeth Though, you're on a 1/1 at the moment. The 3rd will decide
---
So Trance isn't the best film to watch on two hours sleep. Great performance from McAvoy after the one note scowl of Welcome To The Punch.

in @cineword for 'Welcome To The Punch' second flick changed to 'Jack The Giant Slayer'
---
After the lame 'Side Effects' and 'Welcome To The Punch', I hope Danny Boyle has put some thrill back into the thriller. And a script.
---
Welcome to the Punch, Jack the giant Slayer. Whatcha think Twitter?
---
Enjoyed the ride  #WelcometothePunch. Stylish, violent, bit formulaic. One lovely piece of symmetry. Mark Strong as watchable as ever
---
if I thought the Sweeney wasn't a good cinema film, likely to feel the same about Welcome to the Punch?
---
Got to watch welcome to the punch, James McAvoy is in it! *hopefully, this time I get to actually watch it in cinema '-.-* #movie #holiday
---
@Simooonlo After watching Side Effects, Welcome To The Punch and Trance, I could do with a movie of substance. #notjoking
---
#WelcomeToThePunch at the flicks tonight. Genuinely excited. British crime thriller, hellish cast, produced by Ridley Scott. Win all round.
---
@steve_oram Spotted you in 'Welcome to the Punch', 'Sightseers' a much better movie.
---
Also saw Welcome to the Punch this morning. Despite some poor elements it was entertaining enough. Mark Strong was quality as ever.
---
Cinema @samgallimore1 @SophFerguson @fergella #welcometothepunch

#WelcomeToThePunch: a good opening evokes the majesty of Heat but the rest of the film falls short. Mark Strong's face is consistently great

Just watched 2 trailers that were really good (Trance and Welcome to the Punch) and both just so happen to be starring James McAvoy.
