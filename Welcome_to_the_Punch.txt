A Welcome to the Punch/Trance double bill would be like eating a piece of shit and then having a hamburger.

Gonna go watch welcome to the punch today. Looks lively

Welcome to the punch took itself FAR too seriously to have that many slow-mo gun fights.

Let's get ready for work. Come see meeeeee. And a film of course. Mama, Parker, Welcome To The Punch and Red Dawn say bye bye after tonight.
---
Deciding whether to see the new Nic Cage film, or the Brit crime flick Welcome to the Punch tonight. Tough choice. Neither is 'good'...
---
@empiretheatres Canadian fans report that Welcome to the Punch was released 3/22 but no showtimes yet listed. Help!
---
@michaelmoscicki yooo, last exorcism isn't showing but welcome to the punch is, check the trailer, let me know what u think bruh..

#thewalkingdead's David Morrissey appears this week in Welcome to the Punch w/ James McAvoy and Mark Strong - http://t.co/LTYFpLmyBf
---
@WarehouseLDN was your club where they filmed scenes for Welcome to the Punch?
---
Well, so far I can only find WELCOME TO THE PUNCH opening at @IFCCenter in NYC on Weds., 3/27. Let me know if you hear/see other showings!
---
#WelcomeToThePunch - entirely predictable, totally generic &amp; fairly entertaining. Thank god for Mark Strong being in it basically.
---
Seem to have gone on a James McAvoy binge somehow. Welcome to the Punch, Neverwhere and Trance. Not complaining, all great stuff
---
But yeah, really enjoyed Welcome to the Punch, despite it being rather rote. It was *snigger* punchy. And shooty.
---
Per @empiretheatres: We still dont know Canadian release date for James McAvoy's WELCOME TO THE PUNCH. Keep checking back on website!
---
"@wobberlyrobbie: "@YoungReyes: Welcome to the punch?" let me know how it is, it looks decent" was okay, nothing too special!
---
#MovieNFO ( Welcome to the Punch ) Release Date : March 27, 2013. Genres : Action | Adventure | Crime | Thriller

@zoee89 I'm seeing two McSexy films in two days - Welcome to the Punch now and Trance tomorrow night. Yes please.
---
James McAvoy's WELCOME TO THE PUNCH opens tmw 3/27 at @IFCCenter in NYC: http://t.co/f8GFvbIs6n You lucky New Yorkers!
---
Go see Welcome To The Punch. Slick, full of action, absolutely gripping. Is Eran Creevy the next Michael Mann? Stylistically, yes he is.
---
Sunday cinema marathon has just finished. We watched 'Jack the Giant Slayer', 'Welcome To The Punch' &amp;  'Oz: The Great &amp; Powerful' Now food!
---
McAvoy Fortnight is going well w/ @sineadskinner, Welcome to the Punch was mint, NOW for Trance on Wednesday &amp; maybe Macbeth again...
---
#MovieNFO ( Welcome to the Punch ) Cast : James McAvoy, Mark Strong, Andrea Riseborough, David Morrissey.
---
Welcome To The Punch...easily could have set it in America w/ Tom Cruise,&amp;Liam Neeson as police captain,glad they kept it Lahndahn #youslags
---
Who'd have thunk it? Two James McAvoy movies I wanna watch. "Welcome to the Punch" and Danny Boyle's "Trance".
---
As Welcome to the Punch is in cinemas, our back catalogue choice today is dir. Eran Creevy's first feature, Shifty: http://t.co/NU8ktgg2Nc

---
@charismagic how did you find welcome to the punch ?
---
@electroross aw i've got it too! I was gonna bring you it. I hope you like it :)
I saw Welcome to the punch today, was good.
---
@brianshelf Mainly because Welcome to the Punch is filmed like a Channel 4 late night drama and doesn't look like a film.
---
@mannerschelmo get to see films you'd otherwise not perhaps take the risk on, like I did with Welcome to the Punch on Saturday.
---
@LondonMovieLoon I couldn't even remember what Welcome to the Punch was when you said it there. Amazing how quickly these films evaporate.
---
@___genius @K1ngEljay @Profexxion "Welcome to the Punch" trailer if ya'll are interested http://t.co/raCAaBRzS9
---
@adilray avoid welcome to the punch!
---
@deepan88 But! There's also Side Effects, Welcome to the Punch and Trance to watch. Hard hard choices x
---
Welcome to the Punch OK double-crossing shoot-em-up. Strong &amp; Mullan good double act but can't take McAvoy seriously with ginger bumfluff.
---
Boom 

@Team_Maza: Welcome to the punch is number 3 in sky's UK top 10!! @Welcome2Punch @JasonMaza
---
@maridt3 2 movies coming out: Welcome to the Punch (3/27) and Danny Boyle's Trance (4/5). ALSO listen to this: http://t.co/EhaMGOGelf
---
@SarsBe Welcome to the Punch.
I like James Mcavoy and Mark Strong. It's looks really good.
---
@brianshelf Indeed, and gore. He does gore well. It is better than McAvoy's other film Welcome to the Punch.
---
@picturehouses Danny Boyle's has made a successful comeback. And I have forgiven James McAvoy for Welcome to the Punch.
---
@NinaWarhurst Seen "welcome to the punch"? Enjoyed that slightly more
---
Seriously @CineStHelens Please tell me you didn't just post a massive spoiler in my timeline for Welcome To The Punch?!
---
@satyamos welcome to the punch or identity thief at 9? which one
---
@thommoj03 yeah it seams that way. It was similar to welcome to the punch although that was just a strange aqua neon in every scene
---
@zoee89 can confirm McSexy is indeed sexy in Welcome to the Punch but more excited about Trance. Scottish accent plus Danny Boyle.
---
@BFI any news on when the videos from the Wadjda &amp; Welcome to the Punch Q&amp;A's going up, been checking the website, but to no avail
---
@Jenpen21 @kezza1421 Cool. I want to try and catch Oz and Welcome to the punch tomorrow too, but have to be home to cook tea
---
@jpowls have you seen Welcome To The Punch?  Quite good fun, not a massive surprise.  I'm currently in the cinema awaiting Arbitrage.
---
@IFCFilms Fans are asking if WELCOME TO THE PUNCH will get a wider theatrical release in US beyond NY/LA? Please...
