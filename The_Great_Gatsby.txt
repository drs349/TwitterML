One must consider the most  obvious possibility. That 'The Great Gatsby' has always been something to read, rather than film.

there are just some novels i prefer to the movie. 'the reader' being one... hopefully 'the great gatsby' does the novel some justice.

One must consider the most  obvious possibility. That 'The Great Gatsby' has always been something to read, rather than film.

there are just some novels i prefer to the movie. 'the reader' being one... hopefully 'the great gatsby' does the novel some justice.
