@BretEastonEllis watch the new doc ROOM 237, it actually tries to answer all these questions you have about the shining.

my primary conclusion drawn from ROOM 237: Kubrick was an obsessive-compulsive paranoid and, as such, appeals to other 0-C paranoids.

@BretEastonEllis maybe we'll have to wait to see ROOM 237 to find out.
