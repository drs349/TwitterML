@Dcasto128 Can I borrow your broom, thanks. #hummbabe #firedusty #redlegs #Braves

If Aroldis Chapman pitched for the #Reds in 57, he'd be pitching for the "Redlegs," which given the news today, might be fitting.
---
Chapman put the team on his back tho... hey jason heyward, hold muh diiiiick #gotheem #gasolina #redlegs

B. Phillips killed the ball tonight.. Two home runs!! #REDLEGS now time to play!! Cheersing to all those who suck at life :)
