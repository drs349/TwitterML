I wonder if the cineworld secret screening will be Oldboy or 47 Ronin...hmmmm.
---
Should I check out Spike Lee's Oldboy remake or nah?
---
Oh yeah, Spike Lee remade OLDBOY for some reason and it's about to come out.
---
Feeling about the inevitable Oldboy pans the way Navin R. Johnson did about the phone book.
---
White people are remaking Oldboy. Just...I want to kill someone now. Please stop it, Hollywood. Just stop it.

Seeing trailers for the #Oldboy remake feels sacrilege.
---
Looking forward to tomorrow, gonna watch #OLDBOY. Let see how this one shapes up compared to the Korean adaptation.
---
A pair of remakes tomorrow? The Departed and Oldboy. Maybe.
---
Oldboy: The twist will SHOCK YOU TO THE CORE. Unless you've, y'know, adore the original and have seen it multiple times.

It cracks me up that the Oldboy remake is coming out Thanksgiving weekend. It's definitely not a Family Holiday movie.

I may have (operative word being "may") seen one of my favorite films of t/year tonight. No, not OLDBOY. But there's a Spike (not Lee).
---
According to observant @ericwalkuski, OLDBOY is a Spike Lee "Film" &amp; not a "Joint." This fills me with the fury of one thousand suns.

I am so tormented as to whether or not to pay money to see the American remake of Oldboy.
---
I want to see ELYSIUM and OLDBOY now just to see how awful Sharlto Copley is.
---
How many different tumblrs are already set up for Oldboy Twitter reactions, do you think?
---
@SpikeLee  hey fuck you for ruining oldboy

Spike Lee tripled the length of the Oldboy hallway fight scene.  (Then it got edited down.)  http://t.co/hJWMuvF2JE

Anyway I liked OLDBOY very much.

@MissBrittHayes If you could watch him in OLDBOY without laughing out loud you are a better person than I.
---
Spike Lee's Oldboy is a typical remake that works and nothing else. It's solid, but never rises up &amp; justifies why this story got retold.
---
Whichever studio is releasing Spike Lee's OLDBOY is doing a good job keeping the twists secret, along with the movie's existence.

@_edwinmichael: My theatre is getting Oldboy &amp; Frozen yassssss

Im almost done 
---
@nayasaa banyak sih, tapi 5 dulu kali yei. Oldboy (2003), Silenced (2011), Castaway on the Moon (2009), Mother (2009), Hello Ghost (2010).
---
@JackGi @carnojoe I'm not dead set against remakes, but Oldboy is a recent masterpiece. I don't understand why it needs to be "translated".
---
@joshbrunsting It's FilmDistrict's last release before they close for good so OLDBOY is getting dumped.
---
@TheNarrator26 i recommend. 
The diving bell and the butterfly
City of God
The Raid
Let the right one in
Grave of the fireflies 
Oldboy
---
@firstshowing Supposedly the octopus-eating scene in Chan-wook Park's OLDBOY reflects something that goes on all the time in Korea.
---
@byRamonLo maybe Ender's Game or Captain Phillips if they are still showing. I wonder if Oldboy opened yet?
---
@Rlevin85 @JHoffman6 @ericwalkuski Lee def. implied that he wanted the movie to be a "joint." I'd have preferred it just not be OLDBOY.
---
@TwinCinema @vjmfilms And it also feels way too "built for blurb" for my liking. Which hey, look what the official OLDBOY feed did.
---
fine then The Departed you can be my modern-asian-remake-of-a-great-movie-by-a-new-york-master movie since Oldboy is pry out the running bye

@BenMcCool Worst fears are realised. Park's OLDBOY is such a modern classic. Why the need to remake purely for English speaking audiences?
---
@HipHopHead_347 @leeza_maria @GilmoreAmanda  @ColinZavitz1 @brengrady congrats you each won a pair of tickets to #OLDBOY DM us your email
---
@scottrenshaw @vjmfilms Also, in terms of non-TV and non-doc work, he's only done two films between INSIDE MAN and OLDBOY: M@SA and RHS.

Watching Oldboy
---
Wait did they remake Oldboy?
---
Oldboy is overrated and overhyped for no reason. Movie is azz.
---
I felt like Oldboy was overrated as hell after I watched it.
---
Judging by the ratings on #rottentomatoes for #Oldboy and #Homefront, this might be a good weekend to catch up on some older movies.
---
Remaking Oldboy should be seen as a sin
---
So excited for #Oldboy on Wednesday. The perfect thanksgiving movie!
---
I had no idea Spike Lee remade oldboy. Badly.
---
who else is going to uncomfortably watch Oldboy with the rest of their family this weekend
---
OLDBOY LOOKS AMAZING.

Oh hell no mother fucker you are not remaking Oldboy fuck you

I only want to see OLDBOY to see if Spike Lee honored the twist, or if he copped out.

i know im late but i finally watched oldboy yesterday. broh....

Damn, @JHoffman6 did not like Lee's OLDBOY: http://t.co/95zVnYQ1oh
---
The English remake of Oldboy comes out this week in theaters. Perhaps that one would interest me more than the Korean version.
---
i'm about to watch Oldboy i have heard it is a good movie. We will see.
---
Oldboy
---
and with that @davidehrlich just sold a ticket to OLDBOY.
---
I'm assuming Oldboy is being released around Thanksgiving only because it's technically a family movie

Feeling peckish, @ellstar? #Oldboy http://t.co/aFQsKejCbm

Lots of disappointment for Spike Lee's OLDBOY. http://t.co/ngi6OWv1tv

So Oldboy is coming out on the 27th and as much as I believe I won't like it, I still want to see it. xD

I watched OldBoy like 10 years ago.... Park is 1 of my favorite directors....

OLDBOY looks great. Excited to see Hollywood come up with an original idea for once.
---
Now that it's here, I'm really excited to see Lee's OLDBOY. Like...uncontainable.
---
the U.S. version of Oldboy looks promising thank baby jesus 
---
An American version of Oldboy? Come on bro!

Oldboy in theaters this Thanksgiving. I mean it is a family movie. A creepy one, yes. But a family movie nonetheless.

i saw the trailer for the oldboy remake and it made me just want to watch the original instead. i aint gotta wait!!! its right here!
---
The Oldboy remake keeps the twist. I don't care. I don't wanna watch it
---
Love going for a ride with @petehargroves really good for moral, felt like a goat! #oldboy

Oldboy is gonna be awesome. The original version made me wanna puke at the end.

Hope we get to see Oldboy this weekend, but I have a feeling it won't be playing here for some dumb reason.
---
New OLDBOY was the WORST. Proves that remakes are a total waste of time. C'est tout.
---
Just finished watching Oldboy, the Korean original film.  So good.  Can't imagine the American remake being that extreme and graphic.
---
.@SpikeLee Why is #Oldboy a "film" and not a "joint" in the credits?
---
Watching Oldboy againnnn

The largest theatre in Pittsburgh will show OLDBOY twice.  Per day.  Ouch.

Thanks for recommending Oldboy it ruined my life @sarinaisamoon
---
#Oldboy did not need a remake. Ironic that Spike Lee of all people has turned a masterpiece into a stupid detective story for white people.
---
I just saw that they re-made Oldboy. NO! NO! NO! You cannot improve perfection!!!
---
The more I read about it, the more I feel like I'm gonna be in the minority on Spike Lee's OLDBOY (i.e. really like it).
---
Drink every time someone mentions Sharlto Copley is over the top in OLDBOY.
---
Interested in seeing Spike Lees #Oldboy, but critics are just hammering it. Its at the back of the queue so well see.

Welp, think I can officially say I'm no longer looking forward to Oldboy or Walter Mitty now.

No drawing about Oldboy until 3:00 @AndrewJParker @movie_knight @EM6211
---
Finally, everyone who's spent every day of the last 9 years desperate for a Spike Lee remake of Oldboy can rest peacefully.
---
A movie like 'Oldboy' should not be remade. I like Spike Lee but don't think he will be able to capture the true essence of the classic.
---
HE DOES IT AGAIN!!!!!!! CONGRATS!!!!!

---
Looks like the new Oldboy, Philomena, Nebraska, Dallas Buyers Club and maybe Homefront will be seen this week.

John Landis is right. If Hollywood was really risky they'd have remade Oldboy with Will and Willow Smith.

The Oldboy remake is seriously gonna flop so hard I don't even know how this got green-lighted in the first place

If I'm correct, then the new movie OldBoy is a remake of a Korean movie called OldBoy lol

Do my six year-old nephews need to see the original Oldboy before we go to the remake? They love The Goonies so are already big Brolin fans.

There are people who don't like the original Oldboy/ Sympathy for Lady Vengence/ Park Chan-Wook's films? Get out of my office.
