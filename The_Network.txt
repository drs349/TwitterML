@jayleif Starhub here. Same thing. Think it's the network grid itself.

@MentalRiot Unless you're a Nielsen family, that's not true.  You have to let the network know.

@lacluyze Just what I'm gleaning from Jack and others on the network.

'Full profiles for 3rd-degree connections are available only to premium account holders.' - seriously LinkedIn? Paywalling the network. Meh.

@SkyHelpTeam do you know, I never spotted that until this problem! Ok. Thanks for your help. I'll check the network and get back to you.

@MissNikkiBee That's not what I like to hear, Niki Bee! Can I check out the network for you? What zip code? Also, happy birthday! *CDM

@jaysickuh That's no good. No 3G or 4G icon? What's a zip code of your area I can check into the network for you? *CDM

@kelseyygraham Me, too! Let's hope the network doesn't screw up and cancel an excellent show. Very smart.

@roshOPC Yes that's true and then there's a few that would shape based on how busy the network is. I prefer shaping any day.

@LonMcGregor Have you allowed Opera to access the network in your firewall or antivirus settings? ^KE

@NigmaNoname it's  made for cyber cafes so they don't have to play through the internet with other ppl in the network.

@InUrDreamz_ @WorldWar_Zeee yall can always download the old one and restore it to that. however on the network THAT will become buggy

@MrChangeDragon It's what the network wants, why bother to complain.

@DramaOn4 From the network that brought us one of the greatest TV shows of all time, Lost, no wonder #AgentsofSHIELD is already a winner!

@AlizeaKaren The network owners re-branded Style to new Esquire Network. Esquire will take the place of Style. -Nick

@vivekv others beyond. Some factors beyond our control, but which hugely &amp; adversely impact data usage can impact on the network and signal

@AndrewJTom It's not their fault. The commercials are the only reason the show exists at all. The breaks are mandated by the network.

@bribri_love6 that's what I'm saying! Like wow stupid producers! The network knew better than to end it like that!

@otwellc I'm saying this as a friend, and someone who really enjoyed working for the network. You're putting everyone on edge.

@OriginalOestrus I was  with the network for 5 years. I put in quite a bit of work, but it was fun. I repped it every event I went to.
---
@hsi_kf There may indeed be some travelling along the line, but they are planned into the network so hopefully should be no problems today

@boymetworld91 I'm a huge fan of both Marvel and Joss Whedon. With ABC also at the helm, the network responsible for Lost, it will be superb
---
@LowestCommonDen thanks. The network that excites me right now is GNUnet
---
@scott_lowe Absolutely. I will need to try and write some scripts to see how that works out. The "network slicing" stuff was very cool.
---
@RealNealMayhem we read scripts before it's shot then watch cuts. The network doesn't want the f word so you won't hear it.
---
@TheRealDamany watching Deon Sanders, Michael Irving and Michael Vick on The Network! vx

@RWbyNokia yeah. I'm on amber. It's so weird :( it sees the network, just can't join it any more.

@yateley7 Sorry for this Marvin. When there are disruptions on the network we have to utilise the remaining fleet as best we can. Eli.

@arbitraryM I'm waiting for all the network fall promos to be set to that faces I remember WB promo from way back when
---
@Petercampbell1 My apologies Peter. We've had disruptions on the network this morning, and have had to make certain compromises. Eli.
---
@elizabethamber @RyanSchrodt the network has a habit of doing that in the promos as well. some weeks i can't watch any ABC until it's on.
---
@bsstaveley We have piloted wifi before, but due to the complexity of the network it caused more frustration that being without.
---
@HinkleBradley @FoliageNetwork heh...says right on the map 'no coverage,' meaning no spotters there who report back to the Network.

@TMobileHelp multiple times a day. I've reset the network, powered the phone off. All that. Still miss MANY calls. Where's your manager?

@Ognir2 That's just 2x4tb. I prefer a NAS on the network to USB
