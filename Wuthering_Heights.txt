Reading "Wuthering Heights"... Emily Bronte's poetic prose is stunning...

Last thing about Wuthering Heights: it's just an ugly film. It leaves a distaste in your mouth. Two hours of depressing monotony.

Someone on Amazon re the greats of literature like 'Kane and Abel and Wuthering Heights'. I am no fan of E. Bronte, but that is a bit harsh.

I won't be going to see the new Wuthering Heights movie.  Hated that book.  Kept waiting for Heathcliff and Cathy to quit their bitching.
