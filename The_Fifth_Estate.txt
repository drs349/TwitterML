@jamesrbuk Thanks! That just made my day. I'm going to see the Fifth Estate in the black suit, red tie combo.

@amuredda I blame Henry Louis Gates for The Fifth Estate too. Why not.

'The Fifth Estate' - brilliant acting by all, oddly compelling and yet cold as fuck at the same time, heavy-handed in its use of metaphor.

Enjoyed The Fifth Estate, even if Eggs Benedict Cumbernauld-playing-Julian Assange looks disturbingly like the woman I'm going to marry.

I hope The Fifth Estate is the high-octane fueled thrill-ride through the haunted chasm of State Dept. propaganda that Mediastan wasn't.

Wiki-wiki-wikileaks. Seeing 'The Fifth Estate' screening. Did you get that? (@ AMC Mission Valley 20) on #Yelp http://t.co/y1jlnwXXDn
---
Cumberbatch is very good in THE FIFTH ESTATE but Bruhl &amp; Thewlis steal the spotlight. Also enjoyed Linney &amp; Tucci as snarky gov't officials.
---
@annetdonahue The Fifth Estate: The Mitt Romney Story
---
@RorMachine I only spotted it by chance while looking for something to watch...I just don't fancy THE FIFTH ESTATE, despite the cast.
---
@Flavia_of_Zenda @TheAliNasser #TheFifthEstate it's not out yet here
---
@jamesrbuk I just saw The Fifth Estate last night. Made me want to watch "We Steal Secrets."
---
@spoiledmomx4 The Fifth Estate movie , I hope crashes and burns faster than Boehner ! that Vile Assange belongs in Gitmo

---
@labuzamovies Same but The Fifth Estate and digital and not very stoked.
---
@star98hope I guess so. But I'm looking most forward to The Fifth Estate because of Brhl :)
---
@peacekitty333 If all goes well, I'll see the Fifth Estate on Friday. Instead of Thor, Daniel Bruhl will take on Sherlock/Khan.
---
@wikileaks Diana was considered 'limp' at 623,051, and that's still 100,000 more than #TheFifthEstate http://t.co/PGEro3fx9d
---
@purpleclaire @Lawrence @TheLastWord Josh Singer is my guess. He is one of the writers from The Fifth Estate.
---
@antbit @darklonelywater @filmlandempire It's what THE FIFTH ESTATE wishes it was. Only Cumberbitches truly satisfied by FE.

@juanmadpelicula @MarioAlegre que tal The Fifth Estate??

@SharkJumper Hubs and I talking after we saw #TheFifthEstate. He says EVERTONE sgphould be known. I'm not so convinced...

The Fifth Estate promises to break new ground in the cinematic art of ostentatiously-scored-and-edited-scenes-of-dudes-typing-at-computers
---
@believeinsh2012 @Gingerbread_Jim Just seen it for the 2nd time. Even better this time around #TheFifthEstate
---
First thought: why would he sign a CBC news show poster? MT @Cdnscifigal: WIN A THE FIFTH ESTATE POSTER SIGNED BY BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!...
---
@googumproduce it was some ad for "The Fifth Estate", with a trailer guy-ish voice,making it sound like the greatest thriller of our lives
---
@dirkliedtke See press releas by Wikileaks: #Medistan is seen as an "antidote" to Cumberbatch movie "The Fifth Estate"

@Tanooki_Lass JCAKE JCAKE! Saw The Fifth Estate this evening, Benedict and Daniel Bruhl on the same screen was such a drool fest &lt;3
---
@JimJam I went to see The Fifth Estate - the film about Wiki Leaks.. Was interesting to see how it all worked! Captain Phillips next week??
---
@msjconnolly The fifth estate is definitely against Assange. Anti-wikileak propaganda. See Mediastan! :-)
---
@Yassammez @abeetata @oldbluehouse ;0 The world needs to KNOW.  I'll have to DVR it myself, as Mom and I will be at #TheFifthEstate.
---
The Fifth Estate is such a bad film, ended up walking out of the cinema
---
Lady behind me on THE FIFTH ESTATE: "I don't know what this is about but I think it's real estate. Because it says estate." #contextclues
---
Vaguely disappointed that the Fifth Estate has nothing to do with the Fifth Element. :/

---
To be honest, I have no interest with The Fifth Estate.
---

---
Not sure what's sillier and more off-putting: ads for The Fifth Estate or WikiLeaks war against The Fifth Estate
---
'The Fifth Estate' looks interesting, but I think coming out the same weekend as '12 Years a Slave' was bad timing. We'll see...
