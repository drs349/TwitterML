I want the Kings to go to the Cup, but I like this Yotes team a lot so I can live with them winning

idk who to root for to win the Cup..the Kings or the Coyotes!? with my OG Coyotes ties and all..
---
Coytoes and Kings are making great stories. Hope this series goes 7; I hate the fact that one of these teams won't go to the Cup.
---
The Capitals remind me of Montreal from 2 years ago... and the Hurricaes team that won the cup a few years ago.
---
Raining in Toronto at the moment, looks like it's beginning to clear, though. Should be a comfortable night for the Cup semi. #TFC #IMFC

The lowest seed to win a #StanleyCup is the 1995 New Jersey #Devils as a 5 seed. If history serves either #Phx or #NYR will win the Cup.
---
Feeling the need to uncomplicate things romantically a little. So I'm cleaning the cup cupboard out to avoid this. #adventuresindating

i expect a more festive party than the inauguration of the stadium, i hope there will be a great pyrotechnics as Capitano lift the cup..
---
They're battering Chelsea here! Hand them the cup!! Oh wait.... Oh sorry, beating them only mattered three days ago.... My apologies.
---
nothing against the Preds, but i'm glad Carrie Underwood will be nowhere near the Cup this year. #completelyarbitraryopinion
---
i expect a more festive party than the inauguration of the stadium, i hope there will be a great pyrotechnics as Capitano lift the cup.

So the Kings are gonna win the Cup, and the Flyers will be eliminated on a goal scored by Bryzgalov. Fuck you Ed Snider
---
i want the caps to win 1)tortorella's presser 2) holtby 3)all the top pics to win the cup will be out

One does not simply win the cup by scoring on your own goal. #bryzgalov #nhlplayoffs

Everytime devils have beat flyers in playoffs they have won the cup @JayWalkerMVP

That moment when u drink something nasty and u look at the cup with a look on ur face like ''wtf is this nasty shit?''

Carroll has carried his form from the cup final into this game. I hope he can grab another goal tonight!! #YNWA #lfc

Legend!! You're a superstar @daplusk, one of the smartest minds I know.  I'm so honored for the cup you have bestowed upon me.  Love ya! :)

@NYYNerdBomber If the Rangers win the cup, I think you will have to give Joel Ward a ring too after his penalty last night

That 4-1 win over the cup winners sets Liverpool up as odds on title favourites for me next season.
---
Why are people making "If the #Yotes win the Cup,Gary Bettman will give the Cup to himself first" jokes??..Hockey doesn't work that way -__-
---
Because you spent $51 on a goalie, because you traded Richards, because you signed Carle to an extension, because it's the cup.
---
W/ 8 seconds left in the Ranger's game , I thought their season was over. W/ 6 seconds left I changed &amp; think they r destined 2 win The Cup.

Whatever, #bandwagon2012 is all for the LA Kings now.  If the Caps or Devils can't win the Cup, I want Richie and Carts to do so. YEAH.

Really weirds me out how fast I stop caring when the Fliers are no longer in the running for the Cup. #NHL apathy woooooah!
---
Boy: Why these people running? Dad: Winner of the race will get the cup. Boy: If only winner will get cup, why others are running? :)
---
As long as the Caps get eliminated next I'm ok with whoever wins the cup this year but I'm rooting for the Rangers &amp; Kings!!
---
Kenny's critics will say he's made lots of mistakes this season, his biggest one though is leaving Carroll out of the cup final...
---
Oh FFS couldn't Liverpool have played like this last Saturday? We would have won the cup #football
---
One of my favourite shots at The Players on #17. Couples in the water, re-tee, in the cup for a 3. Crazy way to make par there.
---
Is John Terry still nursing a hangover from the cup celebrations? Absolutely abysmal.
---
On another note, regardless if Phoenix wins the cup or not I think Doan should retire. Farthest he's ever gotten in the post season.
---
Ok.. so I won't shave my face bald when the cup is hoisted.. but I will likely trim to keep it tamed. #YearRoundBeard 8D
---
As I have aptly pointed out to @QSTJHoops before: the Rangers may win the cup, but I fully expect them to play 28 games to get there.
---
The cup final was a 2 leg affair right?.....  Well played boys, showed charachter. #LFC

If a Staal doesn't get the Cup, and it doesn't go to the West, I'm cool with Marty getting it. Options people - options.

So, who picked the #Coyotes, #Kings and #Devils in the conference finals.. 75% chance one of those teams will be lifting the cup in June
---
Sorry NJD beating a goalie challenged team does not mean they will win the cup they make it to finals they have to get by Quick or Smith
---
Another serious shift by the big man tonight. Since Utd in the cup he's been an absolute collosous. 35 million well spent! Yes, I said it!
