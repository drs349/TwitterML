Cuenca: "Villa is doing quite good, he's making quick progress, but I can't say if he'll be ready for the cup final and the Euro." #fcblive

Barcelona could play a friendly game in Europe on Wednesday 16 or Thursday 17 May to not lose the rhythm ahead of the cup final. [md]

Puyol has a knee injury. He could have to undergo surgery and would then miss the cup final and the Euro. Further tests later today. [md]

Looking forward to the 2nd leg of the Cup Final tonight.  Big away goal for Liverpool.  #CouldBeCrucial
---
I still think it would be a cool idea to have the captain of the previous Stanley Cup champ present the Cup to the captain of the new champ.
---
Liverpool winning their cup final. We won THE cup final. I'll take that.

Devils 1st Conference Finals appearance since 03 when they won the Cup. Ilya Kovalchuk: goal, assist (7 points in series) #didzajactouchit
---
If it's a repeat champion, have the previous different team's captain still present the Cup. I believe that's how the Masters does it.

When the #Oilers won the Cup in 1990, captain Mark Messier hoisted the Cup and shouted, "This one's for you Gretz!" #RandomNHLfact
---
If the last task in Goblet of Fire was done at Dharavi, no one would ever find the cup.
---
I want the Rangers to win Game 7, it'd be more exposure for hockey. But damn do I want to see Ovi win the Cup.
---
when the cup you're drinking out of opening is bigger than your face &lt;&lt;&lt;
---
I'm glad we are winning but if they had put this effort in on sat we could of won the cup
---
The Pens won't win the Cup this year, but I take great joy in knowing the Flyers won't either. I'll take that.
---
I hope that if the #Coyotes go all the way, @biznasty2point0 puts his Twitter handle on the Cup
---
I hope guys going to Anfield tonight don't sing the national anthem. You know that offends the locals. #cfc #chelseafc Don't mention the Cup
---
Why didn't Liverpool play like this to win the cup the other day?
---
The Coyotes need to win the Cup in order for me not to be pissed. The fuck is that.
---
I can't believe Lemieux forced the NHL to make Bryz make that horrid turnover so the Penguins would have a better chance of winning the cup
---
Looks like Liverpool got confused about which was the cup final and which was the league game.
---
@sillywampa the last 3 years, the team that beat the flyers went on to win the cup.
---
Can someone make a detailed case for either the Devils or the Capitals to win the cup. (pick one) I'll publish 4 or 5 tweets in #TweetSpot
---
For the sake of my sanity and the unfollow button, if the Kings win the Cup I will die haha
---
@iBlameMikeGreen: But Max Talbot I thought you wanted to go to a team that would win the Cup. thisss

Let's take Adam Oates. An incredibly skilled player, amazing, who has not won the Cup. Does this mean his skill got him nowhere?

Kenny Dalglish said to us Andy Carroll was unplayable tonight. Can't disagree carried his half hour in the Cup Final on into tonight's game

The one benefit of the NHL's new playoff campaign is me answering "Because It's The Cup" to everything my friends say.
---
Can anyone make a detailed case for the Coyotes to win the cup? #TweetSpot

People who leave the tea bag in the cup after they've added milk disgust me.
---
That little white NASCAR lady doesn't have ANYTHING on me, sign me up, I'll bring the cup home
---
The cup I'm drinkin water out of smells like a dog.

So when the Coyotes win the Cup, what's the parade route going to look like in Quebec?
