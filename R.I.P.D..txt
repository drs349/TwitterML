Everyone who (jokingly) mocks me for liking Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter should have to watch that and R.I.P.D. back to back.

Sometimes the studio has a good movie and they don't know it. R.I.P.D. is not that. It's the epitome of bad. At least Jonah Hex had Fox.

R.I.P.D. somehow gets bad performances from A) Jeff Bridges, B) Kevin Bacon, and C) Mary-Louise Parker. Takes real skill to pull that off.
