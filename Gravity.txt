This is a nice @Wired interview with #Gravity director Alfonso Cuarn. He talks space, metaphors, &amp; Children of Men: http://t.co/SUYDFTbewn

Gravity looks to be the most spectacular anxiety attack I will ever have in a movie theater.
---
I was more emotionally moved by a season three episode of 'The Walking Dead' than #Gravity. #justsayin
---
Oh Gravity, Gravity, #Gravity

"This is breathtaking, dizzying filmmaking. This is truly awesome" http://t.co/E78bGdnMRu Gravity in theaters tonight http://t.co/gvc901Ygks

"@keamoneyy: I must go see Gravity." i wanna see it but i know ima cry
---
If you go to see Gravity this weekend, do yourself a favor and see it in 3D at a theater with Dolby Atmos. #worthit http://t.co/LB0Nf1lGyA
---
In 2006, Pan's Labyrinth got a 98, besting #gravity's high score of 97 on @metacritic.
---
I don't think you want to see Gravity as much as I want to see Gravity.
---
#Gravity is 98% fresh on @RottenTomatoes and you can see it first tonite at 10PM in @RealD3D or @IMAX 3D! Get tix! http://t.co/pG3lfUhAhy
---
Gravity is absolutely a reason to rejoice. It's a simple suspense / disaster / sci-fi film that's made with a ridiculous amount of care.
---
#GRAVITY is a must see! Thanks @WBPictures and Klout for the early screening. http://t.co/OMRx9Vhcec
---
We didn't have "twerking" when we were your age. We had "gravity boots" and they were a deal more unsightly, if you ask me.
---
Here we go! #gravity http://t.co/Uf4YvAOdWR
---
Gravity. Is working against me. And gravity wants to bring me down.
---
Not that I'm ever going into space but damn if the #Gravity trailer doesn't scare the hell out of me!
---
That was amazing. Gorgeous and thrilling and intense and superb. 10/10 #Gravity
---
Now GRAVITY I'm excited about, even though there seems to be no gravity anywhere in the movie. Imagine if ALLIGATOR had no alligator!
---
Thanks to that Gravity commercial, I now know what Sandra Bullock sounds like when she's having sex
---
Gravity is HEAVY. STELLAR. OUT OF THIS WORLD. See where we're going with this? http://t.co/ayHinl9HjV

I'll be one of the most well informed viewers of GRAVITY this weekend, with NASA's help! http://t.co/8iLFekM2gI

I think I'm excited for Gravity. I yearn for space movies that get space physics right. So few of them do. I expect Gravity to nail it.

Did you ever dream of becoming an astronaut when you were young? Gravity director Alfonso Cuarn sure did http://t.co/igYQ4xOn5F #lff

It seems GRAVITY must have screened enough times for someone to say "No one is left to PAY for it, it'll bomb!", but if so I missed it.
---
The filmmaking in Gravity is next level. I had no idea what 80% of the jobs in the end credits were, it made me feel like a kid.

"@heavenrants: Gravity is basically one long anxiety attack packaged as a movie" yes

Holy shit, GRAVITY. I mean, the natural force of attraction between two massive bodies. I'm sure the movie's great, too.

I wanna go see Gravity this weekend but I am also SO SCARED OF IT

Did anyone else spend half their time watching Gravity looking for New Zealand?

Gravity is rated PG13 for 'existential terror' not sure how to handle that.

Alfonso Cuarn's #GRAVITY is an eerie,tense sci-fi thriller thats masterfully directed n visually stunning. 97% FRESH on @RottenTomatoes ^VN

#GRAVITY is a must see in theatres and opens tonight at 10pm. Be there!!!

I'm not a big advocate for 3D. It's intrusive and doesn't add anything. If you see GRAVITY in 2D you're missing the point.

Not for nothing, but #Gravity currently has a 100% score from top critics on rotten tomatoes. It's called the greatest space movie ever made
