Call me crazy, but I kinda loved Oblivion. The story falls apart if you examine it too closely, but it's so cocksure I don't mind.

For @voguemagazine, I wrote on "Oblivion," which has everything you want in a movie if you happen to be Tom Cruise: http://t.co/RvpvyF6o53

Getting ready to see Oblivion in Imax. I hope it's great. Cruise doesn't always win me over.
---
Rather liked #Oblivion, it was a very good film actually :')

I'm going to watch Oblivion tonight. I'm hoping Cruise is more believable in it than he was in Jack Reacher and his last marriage.
