Liam Neeson Always Has Dope Movies... "The Grey"

I saw the preview for "The Grey" and I think a better title would have been "Liam Neeson Murders Nature"

probably shouldn't have called the man in the grey suit in the station a "f**king great fat bald lump" ... He deserved it tho!

"The Grey" was intensely and painfully gripping.  I enjoyed it, but this grisly thriller is not for the weak of stomach
