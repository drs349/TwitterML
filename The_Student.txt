---
@studentactivism Agreed. I'm impressed w/ the student engagement &amp; organizing in Philly. It's grown so much since the 10yrs when I was in HS
---
@mcuban But when that bubble pops--the debt will still remain the burden of the student and their families.

@phoefgen Really? Asking is fine---it's the student who thinks that I've never done this before that makes me smile, but think- c'mon.
