Just been to see This Means War with Reese JD Wetherspoons, Captain Kirk and Bloke off of Inception. Quite good.
---
"This Means War" looks like what would've happened if Jerry Bruckheimer had developed "Y Tu Mama Tambien".

"This Means War": It's not terrible. But that could be my deep love for Tom Hardy talking. http://t.co/Vi1sfCei

I love these "I feel weird about dating two guys at once" ads for This Means War during #TVD.

The ads for This Means War make me think Ryan Phillipe has a chance to win that breakup after all.
---
Given that Reese Witherspoon is by far the most famous person in THIS MEANS WAR, why did they make a trailer where she doesn't do anything?
---

#ThisMeansWar is a bad movie that's easy to sit through. "Coriolanus" is a good movie that's hard to sit through.

This Means War: Very entertaining but the girl isn't worth to be fought over by 2 hot guys. She's not too sexy for type of blonde girl
