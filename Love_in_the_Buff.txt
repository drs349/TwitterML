I'm rather proud of on tomorrow's Simon Says column at @PressPlayIW. It's about Edmond Pang's LOVE IN A PUFF/LOVE IN THE BUFF romcoms.
---
As good as LOVE IN THE BUFF is, Movie of the Week has to be THE GREY with Liam Neeson - thrilling, moving, awesome. #HK #movies #TheGrey
---
LOVE IN THE BUFF very entertaining, though it gets a bit flabby and speechified near the end. Pang Ho-Cheung's most commercial work yet.

@BilgeEbiri I wrote about LOVE IN THE BUFF. Retweet that tweet.
---
@kenjfuj There's no nudity in LOVE IN THE BUFF, whose Chinese posters are apparently misspelling the film's title to say LOVE IN THE BUTT.
---
@simonsaybrams Wait, the follow-up to LOVE IN A PUFF is called LOVE IN THE BUFF? That title sure catches my attention!
---
@Timpson it's been slim pickings but both Pang Ho Cheung films - LOVE IN THE BUFF and VULGARIA - were great.
