Starring Ben Affleck, the highly-anticipated new feature from renowned filmmaker Terrence Malick, #ToTheWonder opens Friday @ the Egyptian!

It's really too early in the year for a Terrence Malick film, but I'm pretty stoked for it. #tothewonder
---
That gut punch when you see #ToTheWonder having a Rotten status at #RottenTomatoes!
---
Not sure if #ToTheWonder really works, but I like that Malick is pushing the boundaries of what constitutes a story.
---
#ToTheWonder, Beautiful. Proud of my father in law @WiiliamRiddle #full life

Do I really have to work the night #ToTheWonder premiers?  #hatemylife

Do admire that #ToTheWonder will release in theater and VOD same day. Honestly, it's the only thing that will likely get me to see it.
---
Three hopefully good movies to see this week! #TotheWonder #ThePlaceBeyondthePines #Trance
---
Also, I don't think I could be more excited for #TerrenceMalick's new marvel, #ToTheWonder.

#ToTheWonder Malick trying to create a new form of story, not just depicting lovers, but trying to recreate the actual emotion of love.
