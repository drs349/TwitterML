@maryannjohanson which VOD service did you use to watch THE CANYONS?

Aww, the AV Club tried to act all cool and pretend "The Canyons" is some avant-garde masterpiece.  They're TOTES HIP, YOU GUYS.

Will I really be able to watch #TheCanyons on @netflix tomorrow? Really? I could die with excitement. @lindsaylohan

I'm pretty sure that whether or not the Canyons will be a good movie is irrelevant to me. It has James Deen, therefore it is perfect.

@timothyeraw How are you seeing The Canyons?

Specialty B.O. Preview: The Canyons, The Spectacular Now, When Comedy Went To School, Our Children, The Artist And The Model

The Comedy was my favourite film of 2012. I think either Only God Forgives or The Canyons will take 2013's spot.

Saw #TheCanyons last night. James Deen ain't no Christian Bale, but it's entertaining...And Text TV is apparently the future.

With the new economics of filmmaking, we could just do this ourselves." Why to watch @TheCanyonsFilm: http://t.co/4jnfdaXVUo  #TheCanyons
---
The Canyons is definitely one of those movies where it's gonna rape every single movie in 2013 this year. That's how much confidence I have.
---
I'm not at all surprised that an actor (not a character, but an actor) in THE CANYONS is named Nolan Funk.
---
"@BretEastonEllis 1m     THE CANYONS will be available starting at MIDNIGHT..." I'm REALLY EXCITED TO PIRATE THIS FOR FREE
