Every time I want to dismiss Jack Reacher, I remember who wrote/directed it and I feel more positive about it.

---
Jack Reacher in the books is 6'5" . Jack Reacher in the movie is 5'6" .
---
Tom Cruise plays Jack Reacher and then Jack Harper. GO HOME HOLLYWOOD, YOU'RE DRUNK.
---
JACK REACHER? I HARDLY JACK KNEW HER!!
---
Seriously, guys, I hardly even jack knew her. I don't know where these charges of jack reacher are coming from.

Is Tom Cruise big enough to carry 'Jack Reacher'? http://t.co/4V5Qcp2z
---
Tom Cruise's "Jack Reacher" is meant to launch a Bond-style franchise, but who wants to watch a shoot-em-up right now? http://t.co/RVyrZMNW
---
Anyone else know how many times they say his name in Jack Reacher? I counted 21.
---
@JessicaNorthey The concept of having Tom Cruise play Jack Reacher is unfathomable. As is Ashton Kutcher playing Steve Jobs.  #APE
---
Wow, I did not see JACK REACHER coming. Then again: NOBODY SEES JACK REACHER COMING.

Critically acclaimed director &amp; enfant terrible Werner Herzog brings villainy to @TomCruise's Jack Reacher: http://t.co/u3q9BoNf

The timing may seem bad, but JACK REACHER itself is quite good: http://t.co/mLlbLkxg

Don't blame Tom Cruise's ill-timed "Jack Reacher" -- ultra-violent films "exist because we eat them up and demand more" http://t.co/xgJH5Xdk

Just once in my life, I want someone to say my name the way Richard Jenkins says "Jack Reacher." Just once. It doesn't have to be Jenkins.
---
Funniest thing of the week, however, was Herzog chewing his fingers off in Jack Reacher. The man is a god. And not afraid. Of anything.

Contractually, Tom Cruise will only star in movies where it's SUPER HARD to make up the porn version title, like Rock of Ages &amp; Jack Reacher

Jack Reacher was totally mismarketed and has a stupid fucking name. Wouldn't be surprised if it bombs, even though it's pretty decent.

at @cinema21 EX for Tom Cruise's #JackReacher screening
---
Seeing my last 2012 film tonight. No pressure, JACK REACHER.
---
The question is not whether Tom Cruise is too short to play Jack Reacher. The question is whether he is too short to face Werner Herzog.
---
Can I just take the day off of work and go to the movies. I really wanna see Jack Reacher, even if Tom is playing Jack.
---
Tom Cruise will be in Pittsburgh tomorrow to screen his new film "Jack Reacher."

Tom cruise as jack reacher is so not right... For those who don't know, the fictional jack reacher is 6ft5 + built like a brick sh*t house

http://t.co/IqmFWsKF

My boyfriend when we saw a poster for Jack Reacher: You know, Reacher is his middle name. His last name is Round.
---
As a Lee Child (author of Jack Reacher) fan,  Tom Cruise is the last person I can imagine playing Reacher. I will stick to Reacher novels!

Surprise,Surprise. Tom Cruise getting laughed at for trying to be Jack Reacher. Here. Reacher 6 ft 5, 50 inch chest. Cruise 5 ft 3
---
I have to say, the more I read about book Jack Reacher, the more it wouldn't work on film. He stopped a bullet with his pecs once. Come on.
---
In the books, Jack Reacher is 6'5. I could be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure Tom Cruise isn't 6'5.
---

@FilmSamurai Glad to see you had a mostly positive experience of Jack Reacher.

U can love Jack Reacher but Tom Cruise is never going to come to your town and act it out live in front of you. Live music wins every time

@andyffgibbons Lee Childs was on the EPK for Jack Reacher, giving it an enthusiastic blessing.

"I think that Jack Reacher guy might be gay..." - A line probably not in the movie "Jack Reacher"

"Jack Reacher " was pretty good. Not great but pretty good.

Reminder, "Jack Reacher" and "Jack Reach-around" are different films.
