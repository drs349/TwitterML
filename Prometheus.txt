Can't wait for #Prometheus tonight. Hoping it finally explains why Ellen Ripley's underwear was so small.
---
Prometheus poses questions and a quest to answer them. It doesn't answer them, and leaves you with more questions. The end. Shite.
---
Just watched Prometheus. http://t.co/SNj7VQ9E
---
Prometheus. Looked good, but was boring and pointless.
---
I am delighted that I said that Prometheus was going to be shite, and it was. Told ye.
---
I have a Sunday night date with my fella to see Prometheus. Can't remember the last time I was so hyped for a movie!

Does Ridley Scott's Prometheus Promise New Hope for Sci-Fi? http://t.co/YXv4MfAF
---
I'm not sure what this means, but we've "found" a clue for some kind of #Prometheus viral game. Who wants to play?
---
I think I spent most of Prometheus saying "ah... what a dick move" and "what a dick".
---
I'd like to thank #Prometheus for making Act I of Alien considerably less interesting than it was a month ago.

Still can't get over Prometheus

Prometheus is a cinematic orgasm and unlike Avatar which offers kiddy story, it's quite provocative.

All my critic friends (with varied degrees of opinion) are still talking about Prometheus in private, a week after the screening.

Michael Fassbender was on the show last night talking "Prometheus" &amp; Irish Heavy Metal. You know you want to see this! http://t.co/tHk0qTQh

Pizza Express gave me a bad pizza. Prometheus, despite the hype, was shite. The Kelvin Way party had no intention of being at Kelvin Way.
