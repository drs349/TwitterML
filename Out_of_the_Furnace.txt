Triple feature today: MITTY, AMERICAN HUSTLE, OUT OF THE FURNACE. Will they all just blur together? Who can say?

Out of the Furnace improves on repeat viewings, once you accept it as a simple yarn. The performances overcome the muddled/rushed third act.

Christian Bale says a pretty good "yinz" in an "Out of the Furnace" scene shot outside RJT's Ice Cream in Clinton, Beaver County.
---
I get if #OutoftheFurnace disturbs ppl &amp; is considered it too bleak but life does suck hard for many. Why not explore that? It's valid.

The first scene "Out of the Furnace" takes place at drive-in in Jersey--where there is exactly one ozoner and zero hillbillies. Dumb movie.

The only 3 'holiday season' movies I really want to see are #OutOfTheFurnace, #AmericanHustle, &amp; #TheWolfOfWallStreet.  Maybe there's hope?
