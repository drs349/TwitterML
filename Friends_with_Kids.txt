@funfinds4fams So fun seeing you.. did you get something done??? #FriendswithKids
---
Agreed @JoLynneS @Babypop I saw it last night with @myantkinney, thought it was quite funny, poignant. #friendswithkids

@ToodiesMomma it's such a good test of friendship too! if they can't handle u having kids then not worth it #FriendswithKids
---
@Hoo_dee_Hoo Add in the SnowCaps for @WhitneyMWS and I. That's my poison :)  #FriendswithKids
---
@classymommy definitely, the challenges come in different ways (5 and 2 year old here) #FriendswithKids
---
@HouseTalkN @whitneymws lol #FriendswithKids they discuss that in the movie. Hysterical scene
---
@WhitneyMWS attended a preview of #FriendswithKids last night. Movie is getting lots of good buzz
---
@classymommy @WhitneyMWS less time to hang out and almost less of a common ground. #FriendswithKids
---
@mellanhead yah she may be my fav. or maya rudolph - she's just so funny #FriendswithKids
---
@JztlikehvnJaiL @ToodiesMomma I just found it's hard to make friends as couples since having kids & being married... #FriendswithKids
---
@mypinkmixerblog hey there - welcome! #FriendswithKids
---
@buzzmommy it really is!  everyone talking about it online this week which is great.  I was bummed to miss last nite! #FriendswithKids
---
@ToodiesMomma my BF from HS doesn't have kids -my having kids hasn't changed our friendship at all. We will always be close #FriendswithKids
---
@WhitneyMWS @toodiesmomma #FriendswithKids good friendships won't change post kids but friendships based on proximity might
---
@HomeroomAtHome I had a crush on Steve :) #FriendswithKids
---
@classymommy same day he had a coupon for blogna--- bologna lol #FriendswithKids
---
@stblissout LOL watched a 30 Rock re-run tonight w/ John Hamm! #Friendswithkids

---
@mom4everandever lol totally - like how the SNL folks used to all do movies together #FriendswithKids
---
@WhitneyMWS Oh, that's what I'm hoping for! We're still stuck in "first few years" mode, but we're getting there! #FriendswithKids
---
Q4 #FriendswithKids @WhitneyMWS it is harder to see our friends without kids because they stay out later and go to nicer restaurants
---
Friends With Kids stars Adam Scott ("Parks & Recr"), Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon Hamm, Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph Chris O'Dowd #FriendswithKids
---
@AudreyMcClellan @ToodiesMomma these stories are fabulous & crazy. And we all RELATE :)  #FriendswithKids

---
@coastalmama01 Yeah I'm often really tired too - kids, work, house, exercise - need time to get it all in! #FriendswithKids
---
@JoanHolub #FriendswithKids opens tomorrow. I saw a preview last night. Super funny
---
@AudreyMcClellan q3 having your kid repeat a swear word in public that they heard from me - oops! #friendswithkids
---
@stblissout I know, right?  A stellar cast list #FriendswithKids
---
@mamafashionist1  omg that is so funny - what a good story #FriendswithKids
---
@classymommy It was a great depiction of life , marriage and little kids- the struggle of the 1st few years #FriendswithKids
---
@WhitneyMWS Q4 there is usually no time to hang out anymore, or pick up and go out without hvn to find a bbsitter #FriendswithKids
---
@shuggysmommy @classymommy @AudreyMcClellan no RSVP, just join in! #friendswithkids
---
@WhitneyMWS Yeah - and I do understand those things. Try to be patient, just chat on phone/email if its easier.  #friendswithkids
---
@WhitneyMWS q5 I think you learn to be more laid back and not let the little things bother you so much #friendswithkids
---
@ToodiesMomma lol, i know..a movie where the kids can stay home with babysitter while mom & dad go out :)  #FriendswithKids
---
@KaratewithaZ oh definitely seconded. No energy here too. I'm praying silently for early bedtime right now #FriendswithKids
---
@classymommy Jennifer westfeldt is amazing in #FriendswithKids and she's a Yale grad too
---
@buzzmommy definitely.  seeing them be good dads and dads who love our kids adds a whole new dimension 2 the relationship #FriendswithKids
---
@funfinds4fams definitely easier. i think my kidless friends like that they can now "chat" with my kids #friendswithkids
---
@ToodiesMomma @buzzmommy @TeamMomMedia that's soooo sweet.  my HS BF is really great with my kids too #friendswithkids
---
@classymommy I've got to see it - sounds like a hoot #friendswithkids
---
@elivya it's hard tho - I can definitely see both sides #FriendswithKids
---
@WhitneyMWS #FriendswithKids, If you have a good partner, it just makes it better and stronger, the child becomes a joint priority.
---
@WhitneyMWS Q3 we all have so many crazy poo, pee, & throwing up stories huh? Nice when we can laugh years later about it! #FriendswithKids
---
@sixyearitch @donnareedsteph I am traveling downtown with @Babypop #friendswithkids @triumphbrewing
---
@classymommy hubby's fav is Megan Fox :D #FriendswithKids
---
@WhitneyMWS @Babypop I missed it too - boo hoo. Been traveling a ton & couldn't swing it last night. #FriendswithKids
---
@JoLynneS @buzzmommy have so much fun tonight ladies! #FriendswithKids #PSMM
---
@AudreyMcClellan @WhitneyMWS Less time to hang out... and there's just a different dynamic with kids around. #FriendswithKids
---
@buzzmommy agree.  it often seems trite. although i will say, as my kids get older i can again listen a little better #FriendswithKids
---
@KaratewithaZ I admit I love the family time too - especially now that the kids are 4 & 6- we can really have fun together #FriendswithKids
---
@classymommy q1 I want to see the film - lots of  great stars in it #friendswithkids
---
@Sarahlynnes oooh I kind of vaguely remember that!!!  funny how you miss who an actor/actress is when you get caught up #FriendswithKids
---
@xxkimhcxx HA that's what i said.  My hubby loves Megan Fox (whose doesn't?) #FriendswithKids
---
@HouseTalkN @classymommy that's awesome - laughing together is key! #FriendswithKids
---
@DonnaReedSteph @visitphilly Ha! We'll totally get there! #FriendsWithKids #PSMM
---
Q4 #FriendswithKids @WhitneyMWS since having kids, it is harder to relate to my single friends' dating exploits
---
@AudreyMcClellan @classymommy @whitneymws is the #FriendswithKids party open to canada?
---
@MOM4EVEREVER #FriendswithKids totally true. My best friend doesn't have kids, but other friendships based on parties faded post kids
---
@Sarahlynnes @classymommy yes it was called notes from the underbelly #FriendswithKids
---
@buzzmommy @TeamMomMedia @toodiesmomma that's so gr8. think true friendships shouldn't be affected by having kids #friendswithkids
---
@etsystalkers @BabyPop I think it gets SO much easier after the 1st few yrs- harder in other ways but easier(mine r 4 & 6)  #FriendswithKids
---
@buzzmommy for sure - who has the energy?   #FriendswithKids
---
@AudreyMcClellan my kids told someone on the hone mommy was kissing the dfedex man- I was hugging him- but they exagerrated #FriendswithKids
---
Q3 #friendswithkids @AudreyMcClellan @classymommy I could relate to the comic diaper blowout scene in the movie. We've all been there
---
@DonnaReedSteph Not sure if I'll make it to @TriumphOldCity but really looking forward to #FriendsWithKids and the rest of the #PSMM ladies
---
@ToodiesMomma totally, right?  Mommy needs movies for her too, right?! #FriendswithKids
---
@busyVAmom Hmm. Did you click on the login button to verify & connect your account? Try that & it should work! #FriendswithKids
---
@WhitneyMWS you have to get them interested in family type activities and  that there may not be as many "ladiesnights"  #FriendswithKids
---
@mypinkmixerblog ssly, couldn't we all, right?  Or a fun girls' night out! #FriendswithKids
---
@SceneCreek Have #FriendsWithKids, but seen it, so hope 2 get #JohnCarter - & Thurs trying for #SilentHouse
---
@JztlikehvnJaiL Try to do at last date nights at home - early to bed & do special dinner, DVD, etc. That's what we did :) #FriendswithKids
---
Q4 #FriendswithKids having kids limits your ability and eliminates your desire to go clubbing w your single friends. @WhitneyMWS
---
@buzzmommy @TeamMomMedia Thanks for joining in the Friends with Kids chat tonight. #FriendswithKids
---
@Babypop did you go with the #PSMM girls last night?  I was so bummed to miss!  Can't wait to see the movie. #FriendswithKids
---
@TeamMomMedia @whitneymws @toodiesmomma #FriendswithKids my best friend doesn't have kids yet..and we are still super close
---
@ginnynotweasley Saw #FriendsWithKids already at TIFF (Really good) so bailing on those tiks & seeing #JohnCarter with @MrDisco3
---
@WhitneyMWS Q5: It makes it more challenging as you have more to disagree over, but it also strengthens it immeasurably. #FriendswithKids
---
@JessicaNWelton @audreymcclellan #FriendswithKids peeing on your nephews leg...omg...what did you do?
---
@sweetmatcha @classymommy @AudreyMcClellan agree!  date night & still having time with your partner alone is so important #friendswithkids
---
@SippyCupMom @AudreyMcClellan Was lucky enough to catch a screening - and will totally go again as date night w/hubby! #FriendsWithKids
---
@deptofhighfives I saw Friends With Kids before Bridesmaids so the commercial for it made me laugh, basically the same cast but dif roles
---
@AudreyMcClellan Q3: feeling the warmth of a baby & realizing you've been peed on. #FriendswithKids
---
@elivya that's tough. maybe they are too tired, or feel maybe you don't want to hear about the kids?  or you'd be bored? #friendswithkids
---
@buzzmommy Love Jennifer Westfeldt - and love that she went to Yale too - but we need a Cornell star next :)  #FriendswithKids
---
@CarseatDancers not at all - just join in and you're good to go - no RSVP! #FriendswithKids
---
Q5 #FriendswithKids @classymommy @whitneymws kids can test a relationship but I also felt more bonded and in love post kids
---
@classymommy @WhitneyMWS Q5: There are definite challenges, but we look at each other in a new way, too, which is neat. #FriendswithKids
---
the #psmm #friendswithkids screening was a ton of fun. Great girls night out pic @WhitneyMWS @babypop

---
@busyVAmom no way?  are you sure you are logged in?  and the hashtag showing on the right? #FriendswithKids
---
@elivya definitely.  going both ways - harder to relate if still kidless & harder for the parents to relate to old life #FriendswithKids
---
