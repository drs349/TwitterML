THE COUNSELOR is getting drilled by critics, which is what I expected after reading the screenplay.
---
I was planning on seeing The Counselor this weekend, but then I noticed 12 Years a Slave is also opening here on Friday.Decisions, decisions
---
Livin' the plush life like Brad Pitt. And on that "The Counselor" screening.
---
Based on some cryptic tweets I've seen online I guess The Counselor sucked. I didn't personally see it.
---
Last complaint: I think Savages said more about the hypocrisy of The War on Drugs than The Counselor.
---
vader nick named his penis the counselor ship &amp; testes the ambassadors.

No wonder they've not pushed The Counselor. I have no idea what you do with that, except push the stylish angle and keep the buzz low.

Who knows when I'll be able to see THE COUNSELOR.

So is THE COUNSELOR another JACKASS movie?

The COUNSELOR has the best decapitation since POST TENEBRAS LUX, also the best car-hood seduction since Tawny Kitaen. Also: it's terrible.

Will see for myself, but reviewerati seem to to believe THE COUNSELOR is too dark and ruminative for the mass-audience-movie room.

@TraceyDukes big disappointment... Great concept but horrible ending.   I think the movie "the counselor" is gonna be better

Who's seen Bobcat Goldthwait's WILLOW CREEK? Is it worth skipping a press screening of THE COUNSELOR for?

@grrrayray fassbender and pitt! I'm totally in.  #TheCounselor

Not really @JCaseyChapman: @AwardsDaily do you think the counselor stands a chance at any awards?

I doubt Cormac McCarthy's read my novel CYNDERE'S MIDNIGHT, but that horrific razor-wire noose in THE COUNSELOR looks suspiciously familiar.

@FyodorFish THE COUNSELOR?

Yes- I'm interested!: From @RottenTomatoes- Ridley Scott &amp; Cormac McCarthy have joined forces in the motion picture thriller THE COUNSELOR

Ridley Scott's star-studded 'The Counselor' is currently 40% rotten at Rotten Tomatoes. Cameron Diaz just had her Oscar chances ruined.

@Cinemanista Great cast for The Counselor although I'm no fan of Diaz.
---
@Cinemanista I'll pass on Bad Grandpa but I wouldn't mind seeing The Counselor.
---
@earth2britbrat oh that one didn't interest me. Ima go see the counselor &amp; bad grandpa
---
@Duckinthedesert It might not be a classic, but a studio won't screen a movie like that if it sucks, like "The Counselor," which hasn't been
---
@scottEweinberg You can say the EXACT same thing about THE COUNSELOR. Hollywood never learns.
---
@JBAwardsCircuit !! do you get a plus one for the counselor?
---
@williambgoss @drewathitfix He has to break out the big guns if he hopes to take down THE COUNSELOR. Someone needs to think of the children.
---
@NordlingAICN the counselor?
---
@gofishbowl: "The Counselor" comes out tomorrow, check here for a behind the "Fishbowl Scene". Take 1 http://t.co/W31Lmf6QsD

@mikeryan I didn't know that.  Hey, do I pass on The Counselor?
---
@FyodorFish @californiabeat Whew! THE COUNSELOR press screening here I come!
---
@DianeRavitch we were JUST talking about how little the counselor talks with kids anymore. Most do test state prep, etc.
---
@raysubers But I'm expecting this week to break the slump with a bang. Both The Counselor and Bad Grandpa look great.
---
@LexG_III Seeing so much snark surrounding The Counselor but I have utter faith in GOD RIDLEY.
---
@Cassidy2099 Are they going to a midnight screening of THE COUNSELOR?
---
@raysubers Killing Them Softly was so dark. The Counselor has more talent, too, including Bardem.
---
@MovieNut14 On the docket for this weekend is All is Lost, The Counselor, Free Birds, and Wadjda. Maybe Bad Grandpa.
---
Ez jl hangzik. @Filmdrunk: The Counselor: Sort of like Traffic as written by Beckett and Kafka.
---
@GermainLussier @russfischer @slashfilm I'll be there too! At THE COUNSELOR (not Aaron Brothers)
---
@bleubelle31 story, his experience rather than an all encompassing view of slavery. I'll probably catch The Counselor on Friday.

@peeablo once at summer camp one of the horses ate a sponge and the counselor had to shove her hand down its throat to pull the sponge out
---
@SamuelAAdams I'm looking for fans of "The Counselor."  I for one was &amp; am a HUGE fan.  Confusing as shit, but the cold integrity of it!
---
@AdvocateKB Dean reviewed Bad Grandpa, the new Jackass movie and The Counselor. Could have been either one!
---
@madmatt213 ok, cool. When are we seeing THE COUNSELOR, which sounds bananas?
---
@XaviXavi22: @JakesTakes who is the best in the cast? Bardem?

Hard to choose, but I had the most fun watching Brad Pitt. #TheCounselor
---
@jmspool LOL - and I just saw the preview for "The Counselor" 5 minutes later - "Rollng Stone says 'Expect the unexpected'."
---
@MisterBrown_23 Maybe 5th Estate wouldve been better. I may end up seeing it Thursday if I pass on The Counselor sneak.
---
@kcenedella borrow for sure. You see the trailers for The Counselor? McCarthy screenplay
---
@raysubers sounds about right. Killing Them Softly was nowhere near as vague as The Counselor marketing-wise.
---
@nandelabra I'm waiting to see how The Counselor plays before I watch. I work all weekend &amp; have a lot of projects to complete so I won't...
---
@SgtNickBrody I feel good things towards The Counselor, but I'm perplexed. Still unpacking it. Ready to see it again- the real indicator.
---
@bleubelle31 No, they just had several costumes on display. One from The Counselor too &amp; another from Naomi Watts' Diana movie.
---
@raysubers The Counselor's marketing has been wider/stronger but the World Series will hurt. Think Fox was rooting against Dodgers?

---
#TheCounselor I'm going to see it alone if I have to.
---
Mx is showing #TheCounselor I'm up in that bitch
---
THE COUNSELOR's commercials and trailers hint at a slim plot centered around Fassbender getting knee deep in shit. Who cares?
---
Just saw #TheCounselor. It's very..... Cormac McCarthy
---
I did not understand #TheCounselor
---
The cast you need to see to believe. Don't miss #TheCounselor in theaters tomorrow! http://t.co/pXt3KGdyWa
---
Somebody take me to go watch the counselor!!!!
---
All these Only God Forgives comparisons are not good. #TheCounselor
---
Marketing for The Counselor is the worst of the year. I have no clue what the film is about. I don't see a film just for the stars.
---
#TheCounselor has masterpiece written all over it. Dying for Friday to come already.

---
I was excited to see the preview of #TheCounselor tonight...until I saw it only got 2 stars #boooo
---
The Counselor is totally a Tony Scott film by Ridley Scott which is pretty exciting. Also the way Javier Bardem says 'counselor' is great.
---
"You dont know someone, until you know what they want." Are you ready for #TheCounselor? http://t.co/5EPqmA8uUQ
---
Tomorrow nigh is going to be #BadGrandpaMovie or #TheCounselor for sure

Oh Jesus, THE COUNSELOR is gonna divisive.
---
The counselor is hilarious on awkward 
---
Does anyone really know what the fucking plot is for the Counselor?
---
About to watch The Counselor. I hear @matinee_cais a big fan.
---
You know a movie is gonna be good when you have cunninglus before the opening credits. #TheCounselor
---
Really loved Cameron Diaz as White Rihanna in The Counselor.
---
Only a movie with Brad Pitt in it could get me out on a school night to opening night of #TheCounselor in uptown charlotte!!
---
So I know what I'll be doing Saturday nice and hungover #TheCounselor @CounselorMovie
---
The counselor is Awkward is so frackin hilarious
---
I just really want to see The Counselor so I know what it's even about. also, Fassbender.
---
I have movie rentals to watch, but I really just want to go see THE COUNSELOR tonight.
---
Any movie preview that features two trip wires already has sold me on seeing the movie #TheCounselor

SO BEYOND EXCITED FOR THE COUNSELOR

@mthev2 want to see #TheCounselor ?
---
For what it's worth, The Counselor is the only film I've seen lately that manages to be one of the best AND one of the worst of the year.
---
Cant wait for The Counselor
---
Cannot wait to see The Counselor
---
Anybody else on edge about the lack of early response to #TheCounselor?
---
Previews for The Counselor are the only time I've ever looked at Cameron Diaz as attractive, other that that, I think she's blah.
---
I hope I get to talk to the counselor about switching to another specialty.
---
Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz? Done. #thecounselor
---
I might go to the movies alone tomorrow and watch The Counselor
---
The personnel involved is enough to have me excited for The Counselor. Some interesting early responses coming through.
---
Really want to see The Counselor....because Penelop Cruz is my girl 
---
I want to see the counselor
---
The Counselor looks like it's going to be dope. Have to go see that

Now a days my best friend is Ms.Sanchez the counselor lol

So THE COUNSELOR is basically this years THE PAPERBOY
---
I know lots of lawyers...but first thing I think when I hear "The Counselor" is still this guy: http://t.co/fJA1ZvBqg0
---
hope the counselor does the calls/paper work, test me soon and i'm out chs !(:
---
The Counselor tonight!!!
---
Going in to The Counselor nearly blind to the plot. The marketing has done a good job of keeping it under wraps so it should be interesting.
---
I can't tell if I'm more excited for The Counselor or Bad Grandpa.
---
The Counselor and OldBoy come out tomorrow
---
When Penelope says "have you been bad?" in that preview for The Counselor &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

UPDATE THE STARBUCKS GIRL WENT TO THE COUNSELOR BECAUSE SHE WAS CRYING.. ABOUT HER STARBUCKS
---
I have to check in with the counselor everyday when I get to school ? What kinda shit is that 
---
The Counselor looks like a good movie. 
---
a lot of early reactions to The Counselor seem to be quite negative. color me disappointed.
---
Ohhhhhhh I can't wait for The Counselor to come out!!!!!! #haveyoubeenbad #becarefulwhatyouwishfor
---
Where's the counselor 
---
The Counselor looks like a movie Im only going to watch because of Michael big D Fassbender.
---
Judging from the WTF reactions, THE COUNSELOR sounds like my kind of crazy. Can't wait.
---
Only because I've loved the quote "this too shall pass" and when I was talking to the counselor today she said that and it stuck out
---
I want to watch the counselor
---
What's the over/under on CAPTAIN PHILLIPS beating THE COUNSELOR this weekend?
---
Ain't been to the movies in a min!!  But gotta go this weekend.. #badgrandpa or #thecounselor ?!?
---
The Counselor = this year's Savages.
---
WHATS THE COUNSELOR'S NAME AGAIN I FORGOT SHE IS PERF
---
And people complaining about the dialogue and script of THE COUNSELOR penned by McCarthy have completely missed the point of the film.
---
The Counselor is bad? I'm so shocked. #sarcasm
---
I just found out Cormac McCarthy wrote the screenplay for The Counselor. Might have to see that now.
---
so excited for tomorrow  #thecounselor :)
@CameronDiiazz
---
@ShawnaWTF is the counselor set up to be a good movie?
---
Just How Weird Is 'The Counselor"? http://t.co/AFSkXIeXdC
---
Some people really hate THE COUNSELOR, which tells me I'll either love it or, more likely be pretty indifferent about it.
---
I wish Phoebe Presley wasn't mean to me unnecessarily, because I'd be telling the counselor on her. I didn't say or do anything to her.

they were tryna make it look like the counselor was gonna be Oscar bait I am so done

---
The Counselor (2013, drama) - a counselor finds a briefcase of money in the desert and an angry hitman (Javier bardem) chases after him
---
Cameron Diaz brings a whole new meaning to "autoerotic" in The Counselor. Yowza.
---
Don't think I've ever wanted to read any screenplay post-viewing as much as The Counselor.
---
So who wants to see The Counselor with me this weekend??
---
In an age where we know every beat of every movie before they release, its nice to be unclear of The Counselors narrative.
---
#TheCounselor opens.  A lawyer joins drug trade. It's one of the most despicable occupations on earth.  And he also sells dope.

My favorite line in #TheCounselor, from among many candidates, comes from #CameronDiaz: "The slaughter to come is beyond our imagining."
