Leme counsel you: #TheCounselor movie sucks, what a disappointment. No development of story, too many plot points missing. #dontdoit
---
The fact that Rolling Stone said, "expect the unexpected" of THE COUNSELOR just makes me think (hope!) @JulieChen is going to pop up in it-J
---
What made #TheCounselor so bad wasnt Javier Bardem.. He MAKES the movie. And Fassbender is amaze as usual. The script was poor, period.

If I have to be honest, the main reason why I want to see THE COUNSELOR is the fact that Ridley dedicated it to Tony. Got sad typing this.
