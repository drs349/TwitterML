#KillList: WTF did I just watch? Worst cult ever. Which I guess makes it a good cult, considering the goal of a cult. 6.5/10

Just watched #Killlist - require a strong stomach in places but a decent British thriller, although not entirely original..7/10

#KillList. That ending. #HotFuzz did it better. Tyres is funny. #Spaced is funny. An A1, tip-top, clubbing, jam fair, this wasn't. #Gutted.

@KELLYCHOI good movie. Starts out real subtle then morphs into something twisted. #KillList
