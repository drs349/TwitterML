Camille Claudel 1915. Best of the festival. Antithesis of the traditional movie biopic.

A historical drama with Juliette Binoche in the lead? CAMILLE CLAUDEL 1915 is still very much a film by Bruno Dumont. http://t.co/BAbWR5PXVk

CAMILLE CLAUDEL 1915 (Dumont 13) [4] Bruno has made what I consider bad films before, but until now he's never made a boring one.
---
Hate to do this, but if someone can hook me up with I USED TO BE DARKER and/or CAMILLE CLAUDEL 1915, I'll repay in kisses.

CAMILLE CLAUDEL 1915 commits itself entirely to its subject's heartbreakingly paranoid headspace: http://t.co/pjKa6aIAy0

Bruno Dumont... A director whose work is very much "under-seen" here in the U.S.A.

"incredibly contained performance that ranks among the best of [#Binoche's] career" CAMILLE CLAUDEL 1915 by #Dumont @indiewire #comingsoon
---
@SodaPictures Saw #CamilleClaudel1915 yesterday @BFI #LFF. Beautiful, uncomfortable, moving, intense.
---
Camille Claudel 1915. Devastating evocation of relations between art, insanity and the spiritual. Binoche almost disrupts with over-acting
---
#LFF Camille Claudel 1915  Not Dumont's finest. La Binoche lifts this typically frugal depiction of sculptor's mental asylum confinement
---
@FilmLandEmpire ... Julie Delpy in BEFORE MIDNIGHT, Juliette Binoche in CAMILLE CLAUDEL 1915 and Isabelle Huppert in ABUSE OF WEAKNESS.
