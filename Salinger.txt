@thehighsign Salinger doc gave me an idea; the *morally righteous spoiler*, ie. sharing the scoops in the doc so we don't have to watch it.

@tinarowley @Caissie Thank you, Ms. Rowley! Yes, it's been great to steep myself in Salinger for this assignment. Seeing the doc tonight.

@studio_gal Maybe we shouldn't know too much about Salinger. But I can't help myself. I'd like to know why he was so strange.

@tinarowley Just saw it and ... Oof. You will learn a lot about Salinger (though not if you've read a decent bio) but soo crassly presented.

@zhandlen @kphipps3000 @nathanrabin Nailed it! The doc can't help but be interesting in parts if you're a Salinger nut, but what a sideshow.
