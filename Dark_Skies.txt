@scottEweinberg If Fox was willing to screen Die Hard 5, you'd think a Dark Skies screening for press wouldn't be out of the question.
---
@fistfulofmedia Maybe he was just doing the Harlem Dark Skies Shake?
---
@scottEweinberg Oh, Come on Scott. No critic is going into a Dark Skies screening thinking "art." Simply, entertain me.
---
@AyeeeMemo hey boo. Are you guys having a midnight showing for dark skies?
---
@xo_katia haha I'm obsessed also!! Seeing dark skies the alien one this weekend. Old exorcist shining and Halloween still scare me
---
@williambgoss @EricDSnider If they think not screening DARK SKIES is going to stop me from paying to see it this weekend, they are so wrong.
---
@williambgoss I was just saying I don't see any reason to think DARK SKIES will be one of those rare unscreened-but-good movies.
---
@OneBebaBitch omg what are you doing tonight like at 5:30? I think I got a free screening to go see Dark Skies in Hollywood at The Arclight.
---
@antoniocampos1 The talk was following a screening of PRIMER, with Shane Carruth &amp; a scientist, while the movie was DARK SKIES.
---
@nmuldoon @joblocom Rewind to December when I said "Dark Skies will be the worst film of 2013." Should have bet on that.
---
@TheMatzy I forgot about lords of Salem and evil dead. For sure excited about those. Also dark skies doesn't look to bad
---
@IridescentBeau ohhhhh hey @dangerouslee  wanna go see #DarkSkies tomorrow?
