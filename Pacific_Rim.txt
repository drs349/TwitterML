PACIFIC RIM TONIGHT CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH!

Ready for Pacific Rim? Weve got a Q&amp;A with the developers of the iOS game: http://t.co/GvEFmTqsrW
---
wonder if there will a porn parody called Pacific Rim Job
---
I hope Pacific Rim is not a big disappointment. The trailer and everything is just so cool. I expect so much from this movie!
---
Ok I'm torn. Stay home and steel-wool my skin off while watching Sharknado, or go marvel at Pacific Rim with no steel wool involved. Hmm.
---
Well I'm very much going to see Pacific Rim first chance I get and it'll be completely awesome.
---
OMG WATCHING PACIFIC RIM.
---
Am i the only person who hasn't watched Pacific Rim yet ?
---
So will I watch Pacific Rim again? Oh yes. Twice if I have to.
---
*controls self from tweeting more things about Pacific Rim*
---
Charlie Hunnam is dang hot in 'Pacific Rim,' so here's a gratuitous look at his sexiest roles http://t.co/wEmO31hynf
---
Wonder how many people checking out Pacific Rim today and this weekend because of Kanye's comment
---
this was, without a doubt, the sickest battle sequence in PACIFIC RIM: http://t.co/gDTGf2oTDU
---
So if you said Pacific Rim has no story, nobody's stopping you from watching Good Will Hunting over and over, man. Really.
---
PACIFIC RIM DAY!
---
I AM SO EXCITED FOR PACIFIC RIM.
---
I seem to be in a minority of people I know who thinks Pacific Rim looks balls
---
Can't wait to watch Pacific Rim this weekend
---
Someone just described PACIFIC RIM as "Power Rangers meets Godzilla." Um, YES, PLEASE, THANK YOU
---
I really want to love Pacific Rim... I really really do...

Not getting the charge that PACIFIC RIM is unemotional, unless excitement doesn't count as an emotion.
---
Please go see Pacific Rim this weekend because you need to support cool movies with $dollar votes$
---
I wish I could see PACIFIC RIM this weekend, but production starts tomorrow. Go see it for me!

"Pacific Rim" looks really freaking weird. http://t.co/TmR3Denljc
---
Okay I have several thoughts about Pacific Rim and most of them are omg the bulldog
---
I felt like a giant kid leaving Pacific Rim. I never thought I'd see a film like that in US theaters. You did it Guillermo! #PacificRim
---
I was pretty ambivalent about Pacific Rim from the trailers, but now Hollywood is predicting it'll fail, I must see it. I love an underdog.
---
Pacific Rim kok belum bisa dibeli tiket nya via M-Tix? -___-
---
Autocorrect keeps changing Pacific Rim to Pacific Tim and I don't know about you but I think that sounds like a lovely film.
---
Pacific Rim sucks.
---
I'm pretty certain SHARKNADO is going to blow away PACIFIC RIM.
---
Eh, pacific rim blon turun ya di bioskop?

I cannot wait to see a huge boat be used as a baseball bat to a monsters head! So excited! #PacificRim
---
The action sequences in Pacific Rim are staggering. Like, mouth half-open and half-smiling staggering. It's the quieter moments that won me.
---
I'm afraid that it will turn out that Pacific Rim doesn't count as an RPG.

Pacific Rim on one of my days off next week is a must.

Really happy the folks I got into PACIFIC RIM all seemed to enjoy it so much. Thanks for all the enthusiastic reports!

I didn't get to see Pacific Rim at IMAX but I'd suspect that's the way to go. You really want to see this film as big as possible.
---
About Pacific Rim, one that I've written in Path yesterday: There is nothing more epic than this to date. Literally. 5 stars + thumbs up.
---
Part of me wants to go see Pacific Rim because many people seem excited about it. Part of me remembers people were also excited about Hobbit

Was gonna see Man of Steel one last time in IMAX but NOOOOOOOO Pacific Rim
---
You have to admit, after #SharkNado, suddenly the plot for Pacific Rim seems plausible.
---
The robots in PACIFIC RIM are called Jaegers. Not a good sign that I'm already tired of jokes about it and the movie hasn't even opened yet.
---
90 minutes before the first IMAX showing of Pacific Rim and I'm the only person in line. I don't get you, Dallas.
---
How bad does Pacific Rim look though, seriously?

Seeing Pacific Rim tonight. I hope it's good.

Pacific Rim is the biggest middle finger anyone can give to Transformers. If you DARE to compare it, you're a fucking idiot.

happy Pacific Rim Day to the kid inside us all, today we're canceling the apocalypse!

No matter how it performs, I expect a Pacific Rim WB cartoon in the next few years. Godzilla (1998) got one.
---
From all this hyperbole surrounding PACIFIC RIM, you'd think it was the greatest movie ever made. It's not.
---
I'm now excited to see Pacific Rim. I haven't seen a really good monster movie since The Host. (http://t.co/UgF6PD5wp8)

I expect Pacific Rim to be awesomely terrible and to do quite badly at the box office.

I was going to ignore Pacific Rim in all honesty, but now I HAVE to go.
---
Pacific Rim Looks Like the producers of Iron Man and Battleship said hey fuck it... lets make a movie
