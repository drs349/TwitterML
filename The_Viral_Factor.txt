---
#TheViralFactor is very much comparable 2 hollywood action-packed films' standard. fast pace, exciting & touching at some parts.
---
What I like about THE VIRAL FACTOR: such much action. What I don't like: bland actors, frenzied (though often admirably nuts) choreography.
---
THE VIRAL FACTOR eschews plot and plausibility to blow shit up and generally be badass. Heroic bloodshed on the grandest scale possible - JM
