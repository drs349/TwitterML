Actually, I guess Gengar is a bit better than Haunter...
Anyone wanna do a quick trade/trade back?  :3 #PokemonXY
---
@lilithia I don't have a Haunter yet! :')
---
At least I can use this female Haunter for breeding right?Cuz that's how it works. I don't hear any journos moaning about Pokemon sexism.
