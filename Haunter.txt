---
@seasiick @JTversion1 someone get me a haunter and chespin egg?

---
@walkstweets I -- don't seem to have a haunter. Which is fine. (I do have some Gengarite, though, so I should look for one.)
---
@bigpizzahut Great!  Going to get my last badge tonight!  Playing a team with Haunter, Pikachu, Blastoise, Blazekin, Chesnaught, Tyrunt!

So.. Sorry @El_Kyablo.. That whole Haunter on Wonder Trade happened to me, and it was female. I still got one on you with Chespin XD
